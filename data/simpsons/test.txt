The Rich Texan: (IMPRESSED NOISE) Marge, you are one fantastic artist -- and no one knows art like a Texan with too much money!
Marge Simpson: (SURPRISED) You're from Texas?
The Rich Texan: That's right. And I wanna finance a fancy-shmancy art show, starring your wooden wonders. Yee hah!
Marge Simpson: (DELIGHTED) My own art show?! I'm so happy... do you mind?
Marge Simpson: Yee-hah!
The Rich Texan: I'm excited you're excited!
The Rich Texan: Yee-hah! Yee-hah!
The Rich Texan: Shoot on the "yee," not the "hah"!
Krusty the Clown: Hey lady, you gotta pay to use my likeness. It's a registered trademark!
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Krusty the Clown: Hey, I do more than TV. I had a one-man show on Broadway. That's who showed up -- one man! (LAUGHS, THEN SERIOUS:) Long story short, I won a Drama Desk Award.
Homer Simpson: Marge, everything looks wonderful!
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm off to pedal my frosty wares!
Marge Simpson: (PANICKED) You can't go to work! I need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!
Homer Simpson: Sweetie, I can't abandon my route even for one day. If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed. But I'll be back in time for your show.
Marge Simpson: The show starts at three. You promise you'll be here?
Homer Simpson: I would never let you down. Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. And trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. In cone-clusion, here's the scoop: I love you.
Marge Simpson: (SWOONS)
Homer Simpson: (FURIOUS) What the hell do you kids want? (REALIZES) Oh right, ice cream.
Crowd: (IMPRESSED GASP)
Homer Simpson: Oh my God! It's the opportunity of a lifetime!
Homer Simpson: Attention, losers: this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love.
Kirk Van Houten: I'm not gonna fall for such a cheap stunt.
Milhouse Van Houten: Mom would.
Kirk Van Houten: (PANICKED) Hey, give me one of everything! Hey!
Homer Simpson: Sorry, I'm all out of ice cream.

Lenny Leonard: I don't know where Carl ends and I begin.
Carl Carlson: (PEEVED) See, statements like that are why people think we're gay.
Homer Simpson: (WOOZY) I made it back for your show, honey...
Marge Simpson: (EERILY CALM) Well, Homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. Good job. Very thorough.
Homer Simpson: Marge, let me explain: I had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families...
Marge Simpson: Oh, stop. Just stop. You don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!
Homer Simpson: (YELLING) Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!
(Simpson Home: Ext. simpson house - night)
Homer Simpson: Marge? Marge?
Homer Simpson: Honey, you've been in there all day. You gotta eat something. Why don't you come downstairs and cook dinner? Lasagna would be awesome. (BEAT) Marge?
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Marge, I wrote you a check for three hundred dollars to pay for all the sculptures I broke. Okay?
Homer Simpson: Oh, I see. You'd prefer a wire transfer. What's your routing number?
Homer Simpson: That's okay, I can get it from the bank, honey. I just need to know your birthday.
Homer Simpson: Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art.
Homer Simpson: If it would win you back, I would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. I hope it doesn't come to that. Could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?
Homer Simpson: If you won't talk to me, I'll send in Polaroids to show you how sad I am that I let you down.

Lisa Simpson: Comic Book Guy! Have you seen our Mom?
Comic Book Guy: A complete list of things I have seen or not seen is available on my blog. Your mother is on the "not seen" list, along with a Star Wars film that was any good since the first one. And even that has been ruined by CGI additions! Bravo, George. (SARCASTICALLY CLAPS)
Bart Simpson: (POINTING O.S.) There's Mom!
Homer Simpson: (TO SELF) Oh my God. She's gonna jump. (STOPS CAR, JUMPS OUT) Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!
Marge Simpson: (CALLING DOWN) Homer, I wanna show the world how I feel about you.
Homer Simpson: The world's not that interested!
Marge Simpson: They will be! (CALLS O.S.) Ready, bullies?
Marge Simpson: Homer, you wanted a sign that I still love you, so here it is.
Homer Simpson: Wow! You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.
Marge Simpson: No, Homer. It's you. My sweet, perfectly imperfect you.
Chief Wiggum: Okay boys, on my command, fire.
Lou: But nobody's done anything wrong.
Chief Wiggum: Geez, if everyone was like you, our morgues would be empty.
Marge Simpson: Homie, I realized that my most enduring creation is the life I've sculpted with you.
Crowd: Awww!
Marge Simpson: Now I know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.
Homer Simpson: I just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?
Marge Simpson: It's in that dumpster.
Marge Simpson: Not that one.

Lisa Simpson: I hope everything's okay.
Marge Simpson: (ON TAPE) Don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!
Homer Simpson: (ON TAPE) You used to love it!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Recording that fake fight was a great idea.
Marge Simpson: Now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle.

Homer Simpson: And, as always, have fun watching.
Homer Simpson: (SPORTS PEP TALK) GOOOO... LOVEMAKING!

Milhouse Van Houten: But what will I eat at mid-day?
Nelson Muntz: I can't solve all your problems -- just hand over the money.

Nelson Muntz: Come to my party or die! (PUNCH) Come to my party or die! (PUNCH AND EXITS)

Ralph Wiggum: I don't like him.
Database: (EXAMINING INVITATION) And I'll bet Nelson won't even have gift bags!
Kids: (APPALLED GASP) Unthinkable! / Is that legal?

Marge Simpson: Well, if no one else jumped off the Empire State Building, would you not jump?
Bart Simpson: (CONFUSED BEAT, THEN) Kind of?
Lisa Simpson: (TEASING) Ah c'mon Bart, the party will be fun. Nelson's not bad -- all he needs is a little kindness. (STIFLES GIGGLE)

Bart Simpson: Why?
Homer Simpson: Son, we all have to do things we don't want to. (BECOMING DISTRAUGHT) Like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be Mr. Funny all the time -- You think I wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? Like some ancient pagan!

Bart Simpson: Um, happy birthday, Nelson.
Nelson Muntz: Uh... I know it seems a little quiet... must be a lot a traffic today. Is highway eighty-eight backed up?
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah. It's a parking lot out there.
Nelson Muntz: Of course! That explains everything. (SUDDENLY ANGRY) Stupid highway eighty-eight! (NERVOUS LAUGHTER)
"Spider-Man": (HEROIC) Hey, kids! My Spidey sense is tingling! Tingling because it's a certain someone's birthday!

Nelson Muntz: Whoa! Me too! We are so connected!
Bart Simpson: (BACKING AWAY) Look, um, I don't have time for new friends. I got a lot on my plate. I've got a big report due on the Nile river: topic sentence, bibliography, page numbers... it's nuts.
Jimbo Jones: (THREATENING DISBELIEF) Dude, you made me get water on my cheek!
Nelson Muntz: Bart is my best friend now. Which means no one picks on him ever again.
Jimbo Jones: (IN PAIN) Okay, okay! I forgot how cool Bart was.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Yeah, he's awesome! / Good guy, good guy!
Nelson Muntz: Isn't he? I've known him for years, but I ran into him at a party and we really clicked.
Bart Simpson: That's right, we're best friends now. (TO JIMBO) So why don't you go pick on someone smaller and weaker?
Jimbo Jones: Good idea!

Waylon Smithers: (KNOWING, VERY FLATTERED) Well sir, a fellow like that might have had his eye on this silver frame. It would go great with his collection of art deco--
C. Montgomery Burns: (INTERRUPTING) Shut up, shut up, there he is!
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS-TYPE, DELIGHTED) Hello, Phillip! What are you doing here?
Phillip: (COY) Never you mind, Mr. Nosey.

KEARNEY JR.: I better go after him.
Lisa Simpson: (SINCERE) What I want can't be bought at any store.
Gil Gunderson: What is it, sweetie? Peace on earth?
Lisa Simpson: What? No! (CATCHING HERSELF) I mean, that's a given. But also, the Malibu Stacy Pony Beach Party Set with Sparkle Sand. (SLUMPS) It's sold out everywhere.

Mr. Costington: Never mind that now! Did you sell the Malibu Stacy Set I put aside?
Gil Gunderson: (SCARED) That was for you?
Mr. Costington: It was for my daughter! (CONTEMPTUOUS, JOWLY BELLOW) You nitwit!
Costington's Daughter: I want my dolly! (JOWLY) You nitwit!
Mr. Costington: Now get back that toy!
Gil Gunderson: Gee, I'm sorry, sir. Taking back that doll would break a little girl's heart on Christmas Eve. And I made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I would never do that.
Mr. Costington: Well then...
Mr. Costington: You're... fiiiiired!
Gil Gunderson: But I...

(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - evening)
Gil Gunderson: AND A PARTRIDGE IN A...
Gil Gunderson: (CHUCKLES, THEN SIGHS) Well, I guess Ol' Gil should skedaddle...

Lisa Simpson: It's Christmas! It's Christmas! It's Christmas!
Bart Simpson: I didn't think it would ever come, but it did!
Marge Simpson: What is all this?
Gil Gunderson: Well, I figured since you invited me to stay, I might as well go down to the bus locker and get my stuff.
Homer Simpson: Marge, we have a problem here.
Marge Simpson: You have a bigger problem out there.
Grumple: Grumply, grumply groo, your blood will make my stew!
Homer Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER, TO MARGE) Do you think that's the same Grumple from the ice show? Because I do.

Marge Simpson: I promise you, he'll leave after today.
Homer Simpson: Really? Who's gonna make him?
Marge Simpson: I will.
Homer Simpson: He sure has a lot of markers that don't work.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - Christmas afternoon - establishing)

Gil Gunderson: Really? You're gonna put me out on Christmas day, huh? (WAN CHUCKLE) Well, that's all right -- I can go down to the men's shelter. I just hope that weird priest with the runny eye ain't servin' soup... 'cause they...
Marge Simpson: Wait, you don't have a place to live?

Gil Gunderson: What a coincidence, I made one too! I'm gonna move my fanny off this sofa...
Marge Simpson: (HOPEFUL NOISE)
Gil Gunderson: ...And move it over to that recliner by the phone. 'Cause I'm expecting a call any minute now from my old boss at Jackpot Realty, asking me to take over the Scottsdale office.
Marge Simpson: (DUBIOUS) Really?
Gil Gunderson: Oh yeah. That desert air's gonna give the ol' one-two to my bronchitis! (LONG, LOUD COUGH, THEN:) Oh boy.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) I guess you can stay a little longer.
Gil Gunderson: Oh, thank you, Marge!
Gil Gunderson: Y'know those floats should really slow down and savor it. 'Cause your life can go to hell pretty quick.
(KITCHEN: Int. Kitchen - continuous)
Homer Simpson: We're not keeping that moocher in this house another minute!

Homer Simpson: Oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors.
Marge Simpson: Please, just a few more days.
Homer Simpson: Marge, admit it -- you just can't say "no" to anyone. (EXPLAINING) That's why you have three kids.

Carl Carlson: Well, you can't kick him out, 'cause then Marge will never learn to assert herself.
Homer Simpson: Well, I guess I'll have to wait for Marge to show some backbone and-- (NOTICES SOMETHING) You again?!
Homer Simpson: What the hell is this thing?

Milhouse Van Houten: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Marge Simpson: Even though Gil left, I still have to kick him out. I need this, or I'll never be able to say "no."
Lisa Simpson: Mom, I understand your psychological need, but I'm not sure what you can do.

Homer Simpson: A hundred and seventeen degrees! (NERVOUS) Ooo, that reminds me.
Homer Simpson: (LOUD) There's water under the seat!
Santa's Little Helper: (HEAVY PANTING, WORRIED MOAN)

(JACKPOT REALTY BUILDING: int. jackpot realty building - top floor - moments later)
Gil Gunderson: People, remember, you're selling dreams! When a family owns a home, it means they own a piece of America.
Gil Gunderson: And what matters most isn't the commission you make, it's the smiles on their faces when they know they own that land free and clear.
Salesman: He's the best I've ever seen.
Saleswoman: He's talking at a Century Twenty-Two level.
Marge Simpson: Gil, remember me?
Gil Gunderson: (CONFIDENT) Marge Simpson? What are you doing here? Lookin' for a home on a quiet cul-de-sac, where your neighbor could be Tanya Tucker?
Marge Simpson: Listen, Bub. I have something to say to you, and it can't wait.
Grampa Simpson: (HAPPILY) Oh, thank you!
Gil Gunderson: Oh well, it looks like we got a Back-out Betty on our hands. But watch Ol' Gil take her from furious to curious.

Bart Simpson: Better than cod?
Marge Simpson: Much better.
Bart Simpson: Oh, baby!
Captain Jack: (WISTFULLY) We brought them in by the boatload, day and night. And then one day they... well, they were gone.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe you just overfished them.

Marge Simpson: (SEARCHING) Oh... well, yeah, the ointments, um...
C. Montgomery Burns: (GASP) What are you people doing in my summer home?
Homer Simpson: (COVERING) Uh, this is Eduardo, my pool boy. He thinks he's an angry rich man.
C. Montgomery Burns: I am an angry rich man!
Homer Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER TO DECLAN) That's the pool chemicals talking.
Declan Desmond: Homer J. Simpson! Your fabulous millionaire lifestyle is all a lie!
Lisa Simpson: (KATHARINE HEPBURN ACCENT) Oh Fah-ther, my pony Buttercup can jump ever so high-- (NOTICING MR. BURNS, NORMAL VOICE) Hoo-boy, it's Mr. Burns.
Homer Simpson: (BEGGING) Please, Mr. Burns, pretend you work for me. You can have the boy, just don't beat him. (LOUD WHISPER) You can beat him, just don't leave marks.
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up, you waste of skin and fat! You've desecrated my every possession!
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISGUSTED NOISE)
Waylon Smithers: (GASPS FOR AIR, THEN:) Oh, thank you, sir! For three days I've had nothing to read but clock-setting instructions: "Using the suspension spring above the pendulum leader, hang the pendulum on the pendulum guide..." (CRAZED NOISES)
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, we're so sorry. The plan was just to use your back yard, and the next thing we know, Mr. Smithers is tied up in a grandfather clock.
Waylon Smithers: Please get me out of here! It's eleven fifty-nine, fifty-nine!
Waylon Smithers: (AGONIZED MOANS)
C. Montgomery Burns: I've heard enough! Release the hounds!
Waylon Smithers: Uh, sir, your hounds are still at the winter house.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, bring them over in the Durango.
Waylon Smithers: Shadow and Winston have been fighting a lot.
C. Montgomery Burns: (EXASPERATED) Put Winston in the front.
Waylon Smithers: Winston doesn't like the front.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SNAPPING) Just do it! Do it! Do it now!
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHATTY) ...and that's how I got the vending machine contract for the Kremlin.
Declan Desmond: (POLITE LAUGH)
Waylon Smithers: Sorry, sir... traffic was a nightmare. Then I got caught in some kind of garlic festival...
Declan Desmond: In the wake of this deception, I had two questions for Homer: "Why lie?" and "Lies... why?!" But he seemed less than eager to meet.
Declan Desmond: Homer, I brought a squeaky!

Lenny Leonard: There you are! I'm ready for my segment.

Lenny Leonard: I am interesting.
Declan Desmond: No you're not.
Marge Simpson: What do you want?
Declan Desmond: Marge, can you just let me in for a minute?
Marge Simpson: We let you in thirty-two years ago and it's brought us nothing but pain.
Declan Desmond: Well, if you want, I can cut you out of the film.
Marge Simpson: No, no, no, no, no! Let's not get crazy.
Declan Desmond: Then I just want to know why your husband did what he did.
Homer Simpson: I'll tell you why.
Homer Simpson: It's been another eight years, and what do I have? Same job, same house, same dirty joke book...
Homer Simpson: (WAN LAUGH)
Homer Simpson: (DEPRESSED) I just thought for once I could be the cool guy in your movie. But all I am is the guy who makes everyone else look good.
Declan Desmond: (TO CAMERA) Strong words from a dumpy man. And cut.
Marge Simpson: Wait just a cotton-swabbing minute! A good man went to a lot of trouble just to impress you! And I went along with it, because I love him to pieces! And you made him look like a fool. Well, I don't want you anywhere near my house!
Marge Simpson: Now you can cut!

Homer Simpson: I'll pay for most of this!
(Simpson Home: Int. SimPSON HOUSE - living room - day)
Moe Szyslak: (INCREDULOUS) Whaddaya been sippin' cuckoo juice? Homer's got it made. He's married to one hell of a woman. All I've got is this porn channel I'm too cheap to de-scramble.
Declan Desmond: (SCRUTINIZING) That's an ad for shoe inserts.
Moe Szyslak: What the?! I've been writin' creepy letters to that?!
Declan Desmond: But what you said about Homer it's... it's given me a brilliant idea!
Moe Szyslak: An action movie where I play the Pope who kills the President?
Declan Desmond: No, that's a terrible idea.
Moe Szyslak: (QUICKLY) Yeah, I know, it is stupid. I think it could work, though. I even got a title: "Pontiff No Return". I came up with it, but I don't really get it.

Homer Simpson: You there, boy! Buy me a Christmas goose! The biggest one in the shop!
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: And then what?
Declan Desmond: Homer, come over here and take a look at this. I've gone over a hundred thousand hours of Springfield footage -- twice -- and put together something you must see.
Lenny Leonard: If I could trade lives with anybody I'd pick Homer.
Moe Szyslak: Have you been to Homer's house?! It's got a back yard, a front yard... the place is like yard city!

Ned Flanders: He's the kindest, sweetest most generous man ever to drive through my living room.
Strangles: (EMOTIONLESS HISS)
Ralph Wiggum: He may not be perfect, but he's my Dad.
Krusty the Clown: Homer gave me a kidney. It wasn't his, I didn't need it, and it came postage due, but still a lovely gesture.
2-Year-Old Bart: I like when Daddy's out of work 'cause he can spend more time with me.
Lisa Simpson: At bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. And you know what? (SMILES) No monsters have gotten me yet.
Homer Simpson: Wow. I have a pretty good life after all.
Marge Simpson: Homer! Don't kill the foreign man!
Homer Simpson: Relax, Marge. (CHUCKLES) I wasn't gonna kill him.
Homer Simpson: All those years I was dreaming of other things, I was actually doing what I really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!

Marge Simpson: Oh, Homie! You make each eight-year interval better than the last!

Gary Chalmers: Uh-huh. Skinner, what is going on here?
Seymour Skinner: (ADMITTING) Sir, if we let these hill folk into our school, our test scores would drop so low, we'd lose all federal funding.
Gary Chalmers: I see. And we've already lost state, county and local funding.
Cletus Spuckler: (CALLING OFF) Hey, kids! The plow mule done birthed a girl-critter!

Bart Simpson: ...And I wasn't planned, so when I came, my parents had to get married. And they were too young and not ready for a kid to screw up their lives. (REALIZING) Maybe... I act out because... if my parents are mad at me, they can't fight with each other!

Bart Simpson: Pinball, eh? I've always wanted to try this.
Bart Simpson: Wow, the graphics are amazing. That ball almost seems real!

(Courthouse: int. courthouse - courtroom - day)
Homer Simpson: I'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!
Judge Harm: Mr. Simpson, do you understand how bankruptcy works?
Homer Simpson: Yes I do. Under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets.
Judge Harm: That was the old bankruptcy law.
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE)
Judge Harm: Under the new law, you have to pay your creditors everything.
Homer Simpson: What the? But I thought bankruptcy was the cool law! The one that says "Dude, don't worry about it. I got this."
Judge Harm: Mr. Simpson, I'm afraid this court must appoint a financial officer to supervise repayment of your debts.
Judge Harm: (CONSIDERS) I'll allow it.
Homer Simpson: (LONG ANGUISHED MOAN)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - day)
Accountant: (STRICT) Mr. Simpson, among the expenses the court deems frivolous: you throw over one thousand dollars a month into local wishing wells.
Homer Simpson: Of course, you idiot, 'cause I'm wishing for more money.
Accountant: Uh-huh. Well you're going to have to make some serious cutbacks to your expenses. (READS LIST) Three subscriptions to "Vanity Fair?"
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) I've got three bathrooms, don't I? Next.
Accountant: Five hundred dollars a month to Totalpoker.com?
Marge Simpson: Shut up! It's an instructional website! Shut up!
Homer Simpson: Give it here, I'll find some fat we can trim. (READS LIST) Here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in.
(Springfield Retirement Castle: ext. springfield retirement castle - a little later)
Grampa Simpson: I don't wanna leave! You promised me I could die here!
Homer Simpson: No, no. This place is too expensive. I saw you doing a "five-hundred piece" jigsaw puzzle in there!

Lisa Simpson: Hey, Mr. Flanders, what'd you get?
Bart Simpson: Some kind of bible garbage?
Ned Flanders: Oh, I wish! No, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company.
Bart Simpson: Could a kid like me get these boxes? Then use 'em for whatever he wanted?
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number.
Bart Simpson: Hello, redemption.
Ned Flanders: Why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
Bart Simpson: (SNEAKY) Oh, I won't. (EVIL CHUCKLE)

Marge Simpson: Can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
Homer Simpson: Sure, but I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Grampa Simpson: I'm scared. Can I sleep across ya?
Marge Simpson: (ANGRY NOISE)
Homer Simpson: What are you doing here, Patty-or-Selma?
Marge Simpson: I invited Selma here to watch Grampa watch the kids.
Selma Bouvier: For some reason, she doesn't trust him. Maybe it's the bang-up job he did raising you.
Homer Simpson: He was a great Dad! Every year he got so mad when Santa didn't bring me presents.
Grampa Simpson: Um... lemon candy?
Selma Bouvier: No thanks, I brought my own.
Selma Bouvier: (LOUD SUCKING NOISES)
Selma Bouvier: I know what you're wondering: how come a single woman with so much to offer is alone on a Saturday night.

Selma Bouvier: My numbers don't get called much these days.
Grampa Simpson: You're kiddin'. A sweet young thing like you?

Selma's Brain: Well... if he dies in my arms, I could meet a cute paramedic.
Grampa's Brain: All right, lips, man your kissing stations! This is not a drill!
Homer Simpson: Well, here we are, home early.

Grampa Simpson: (DEFIANT) Yeah, I know who I was kissing, and I also know why! I'm a little shaky on when and where, but I got my theories!
Homer Simpson: Well I never, ever want to see that again.
Grampa Simpson: Ah, the hell with you. I just might ask that Selma girl out. And you can't tell me not to! (POINTS UPWARD) My roof, my rules! (STORMS OUT)
Homer Simpson: Oh, why did I borrow that roof from him?

Grampa Simpson: Ah phooey on buts! At my age and with your drawbacks, we can't afford to miss an opportunity. Why don't we just spend some time together and see where that takes us?
Selma Bouvier: Yeah, what the hell. (LOOKS AT MENU, THEN:) Wanna split a basket of garlic bread?
Grampa Simpson: Slow down, ya hussy!
(Beach: ext. beach - day)
Driver: Pick a lane, freaks!
Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLING) It's not right. It's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.
Marge Simpson: Be nice, Homer. Don't you see how great it is that they found each other? Like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog.
Homer Simpson: Oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this. Real classy, Marge. Real classy.
Selma Bouvier: Hey Homer, (INDICATES WITH THUMB) that garbage barge is complaining about your smell.

Lisa Simpson: What if we're not here?

(Springfield Mall: Int. Springfield mall - day)
Grampa Simpson: (SHOCKED) Homer! Why would you try to break us up?

Selma Bouvier: Are you sure, Abe? They offered me a promotion at the D.M.V. It's longer hours, but we can afford a place of our own.
Grampa Simpson: Nonsense! When I left PAN AM they said they'd always have a job waiting for me.
Selma Bouvier: (SYMPATHETIC) Abe... there's no more PAN AM.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, I'm an old fool. I don't even have two kidneys to rub together.

(Grampa and Selma's House: int. grampa and selma's house - kitchen - night)
Grampa Simpson: (SAD SIGH) Why is this so hard? I just wanted to marry my best gal.
Selma Bouvier: I guess the Beatles were wrong -- love isn't all you need. Abe, I hate to admit it, but maybe this marriage isn't going to work.
Grampa Simpson: I guess you're right. Also, I didn't realize you liked the Beatles. That would have caused some problems down the line.
Selma Bouvier: (SIGHS) I guess I'm gonna be alone forever.
Grampa Simpson: Now don't be an idiot. A sweet young tomato like you will definitely find someone. Some young bruiser who can eat corn on the cob and not think twice about it.
Selma Bouvier: (BRIGHTENING) You really think so?
Grampa Simpson: Absolutely. Now how 'bout givin' an old man one last dance?

Flint Drywall: (GRIM, À LA ROBERT STACK) You know how many fires are started by birthday candles? (NOT GRIM) If you do, tell me. It would settle a bet down at the station house. I say five, Gus says a million.
Marge Simpson: This disasterette was a real wake up call. We need to find a way to protect our irreplaceables!
Flint Drywall: You could buy a fireproof safe.
Homer Simpson: Or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
Flint Drywall: Sir, we've been here six times this month.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, but uh-- (CHASTENED, "CAUGHT" LITTLE KID) One of those I dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. It feels good to tell the truth. No, I'm lying again, it feels bad.
Marge Simpson: Okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. For me, it's the family photo album.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aw. Our kids used to be so cute!
Homer Simpson: Used to?!
Homer Simpson: Oh, deal with it.
Lisa Simpson: It's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. (HOLDS UP DIAGRAM) So I made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation. (SMALL CHUCKLE)
Homer Simpson: (TAPS WATCH) Tick tock, sweetie.
Lisa Simpson: (QUICKLY) I picked my Malibu Stacy hybrid convertible. It runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.

Bart Simpson: (POINTING) What's that coming out of the safe?
(EDITOR'S OFFICE: int. editor's office - continuous)
Homer Simpson: I don't know. (CONSIDERS) Maybe the Krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, that's ridiculous.
Lisa Simpson: (FRIGHTENED SCREAMS)
Krusty Doll: What's the deal with this "California pizza"? If I wanted cheese and fruit, I'd have to... (DEATH RATTLE)
Marge Simpson: Nooooo! It's gone! That family album was a record of my accomplishments -- it's like what a résumé is for a man.
Lisa Simpson: I agree, Mom, it's very sad. But we'll have to move on -- it's not like we can restage all our family photos.

(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - establishing - day)

Carl Carlson: Yeah, it's an American tradition to cut people down to size because they've brought so much joy into our lives.
Lenny Leonard: You know who I can't stand? That Robin Williams. Y'know one time I saw him eating dinner with his children, he wouldn't take the time out to do all the funny bits from his movies.
Carl Carlson: And my sister once saw Burt Reynolds at an airport, and he wouldn't even co-sign her mortgage.
Homer Simpson: You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. (MOANS) But I threw away my camera.

Krusty the Clown: That's a bad thing! Anyway, we can't afford to pay the voice actors on "Itchy and Scratchy," so I'm doing the voices myself. Roll it!
Scratchy: (KRUSTY VOICE) I'm a cat walking down the street, swingin' my arms...
Scratchy: (KRUSTY VOICE) Look, a lady made of dynamite! Wait, I don't know that yet. How 'bout a smooch?
Scratchy: (KRUSTY VOICE) Kablooey! And here comes the mouse, what's-his-name.
Itchy: (KRUSTY VOICE) That was me that done that! But it ain't enough, so here's this.
Itchy: (KRUSTY VOICE) That's what you get for, uh, I dunno, messing with my wife. And it goes on.
(CHANNEL SIX: INT. CHANNEL six - hallway - moments later)
Krusty the Clown: Damn that Brockman! There are only two rules in TV: don't swear, and don't whip it out! It's not rocket science!
Lindsay Naegle: Kent, can we talk?
Kent Brockman: (NERVOUS) I'm not fired, am I?
Lindsay Naegle: No, no. This station stands by its reporters. Say, what's that powder in your coffee? Is it cocaine?
Kent Brockman: No, it's Splenda.
Lindsay Naegle: Spare me your slang, pusher-man. You're fired!

Homer Simpson: (CALLING) Marge, the couch is lumpy!
Kent Brockman: (ANNOYED) That's because you're sitting on me, you lummox!
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED) Kent Brockman!
Marge Simpson: (ENTERING) I invited him to stay with us for a few days. His career is ruined, (SOTTO) and I was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide.
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry Marge, but I won't live under the same roof as a member of the (SNEERING) "liberal media".
Marge Simpson: (TO KENT) You'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of Fox News.
Homer Simpson: (INDIGNANT) Did you know that every day Mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?
Marge Simpson: We have to take in Mr. Brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
Homer Simpson: Oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!
Bart Simpson: Dad, you barely go to work at all.
Lisa Simpson: And you're constantly flouting the law.
Homer Simpson: I'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. (TO KENT) You can stay. But you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our Wall of Casual Acquaintances Who Came to Stay For A While.
Homer Simpson: (SURVEYING PHOTOS) Apu sang a song. (TO KENT, POINTEDLY) What are you gonna do?
Announcer: Can fifteen strippers run their own airline?
Announcer: Find out tonight, on Fox's newest reality hit, "Landing Strip"!
Stripper: Ladies, check out what I can do with the oxygen masks!
Strippers: (GIGGLE)
Homer Simpson: What a great show: real people with real problems!
Birch Barlow: This is Fox News with the latest (ECHOEY) Liberal Outrage.
Birch Barlow: It seems Liberals want to give NASA the right to "abort" space missions whenever they feel like it.
Homer Simpson: (SEETHING) Liberals -- I hate them so much!
Lisa Simpson: One thing I've always wondered: how can Fox News be so conservative, when the Fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? They don't fit together.
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo!
Birch Barlow: Liberals hate families...
Homer Simpson: (SEETHING) Liberals!
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! (SEETHING) Liberals! Woo hoo! (SEETHING) Liberals! Woo hoo! (SEETHING) Liberals! Woo hoo! (SEETHING) Liberals!
Homer Simpson: Woo--
Rainier Wolfcastle: Oh, you couldn't even get our pizza orders right.
Dracula: Every order is half this, half that. It's confusing!
Kent Brockman: Fox deliberately runs shows that will earn them huge fines, which are then funneled through the FCC straight to the Republican Party. Everybody in the media knows it, but no one has the guts to say it.
Lisa Simpson: Not true. You've got the guts -- and I've got a web cam! This time you can tell the truth...
Kent Brockman: (EXCITED) And swear like a lumberjack who hacked off a leg. Let's do it!
Homer Simpson: (COMING TO LIFE) Hoo!
Homer Simpson: (LOOKING AROUND) Woo hoo? Liberals? Woo hoo?
Lisa Simpson: Here we go. Four-three-two...
Kent Brockman: (À LA MURROW) Good evening. Thank you for inviting me into your laps. Friends, the press and the government are in bed together in an embrace so intimate and wrong, they could spoon on a twin mattress and still have room for Ted Koppel.
Kent Brockman: Journalists used to question the reasons for war, and expose abuse of power. Now like toothless babies, they suckle on the sugary teat of misinformation, and poop it into the diaper we call the six o'clock news.
(Sideshow Mel's House: Int. Sideshow Mel's house - continuous)

The Rich Texan: (THROWS DOWN HAT) Galdarnit! I worked hard to ill-get those gains! How do we stop him?
Dracula: (TENTATIVE) I could Dracula-bite him.
Lindsay Naegle: Actually, Krusty and I have been working on a plan to take out Brockman. (TURNS TO KRUSTY) You wanna start?
Krusty the Clown: (FLIRTY) No, why don't you start.
Lindsay Naegle: (FLIRTY) Oh but you're so good at starting!
Krusty the Clown: (FLIRTY) You really think so?
Lindsay Naegle: (FLIRTY) Oh I know so. Go on.
Krusty the Clown: (FLIRTY) All right.
Lindsay Naegle: (FLIRTY GIGGLE)
Rainier Wolfcastle: (SOTTO) Do you think there's something going on between those two?

Lisa Simpson: Mr. Brockman, you're a huge hit!
Kent Brockman: (BUOYANT) Really? How wide is the web?
Lisa Simpson: World.
Kent Brockman: Wow.
Lindsay Naegle: Kent, we want to offer you your old job back, with a fifty per cent pay increase!
Kent Brockman: (CONSIDERING) Hmm...
Kent Brockman: Lisa, close your eyes for two seconds.
Lisa Simpson: One... two...
Kent Brockman: (DOPPLER) I held out as long as I could!
Lisa Simpson: I guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.
Homer Simpson: True -- but there's room for the truth in this household. (LOOKS BOTH WAYS, THEN LEANS IN) Do you wanna hear something really bad Kent told me about the Fox network?
Lisa Simpson: Of course. Gosh, Dad, your hands are shaking!
Homer Simpson: I know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. (LOOKS AROUND) For years now, Fox has been--
Clearly Dubbed-in Voice: (SMOOTH ANNOUNCER VOICE) ...programming shows that the whole family can enjoy!
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) Oh my God! You don't suppose they're gonna start--
Clearly Dubbed-in Voice: ...entertaining America with hits like "House," "American Idol" and "American Idol Results Show."
Homer Simpson: I'm afraid they might. But I will not be silenced. (TURNS TO CAMERA) The truth is...

C. Montgomery Burns: Ooh, I thought that was a lemon drop.
Waylon Smithers: (EFFICIENT) I'll go get the number de-listed.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, well. What have we here?
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) Why do I need another penny? I have billions. (THINKS) Still, if I don't take it, that hoodlum over there might.

Marge Simpson: (SNIFFS) Homer, you smell like Chicago. Did you fly there on a commercial airline?
Homer Simpson: No way -- commercial is for losers and terrorists! I flew on a private plane.
Marge Simpson: Wow. Is it much different from a normal plane?
Homer Simpson: Please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.
Marge Simpson: Homie, what's wrong?
Homer Simpson: I had it all for one night. Now for the rest of my life I'll know what I'm missing. And all I have to remember it by is that my ears haven't popped. Well, I'll make sure that I never yawn again.
Ned Flanders: Hey Homer!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Dad.
Homer Simpson: "High?" High like a private plane? (MOANS) The kind I'll never be invited to ride on again.
Man: That's where you're wrong, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (SHORT SCREAM) A fresh face!
Marge Simpson: This is Colby Krause. I hired him to help you improve your life. He'll get you back on a private plane in no time!
Homer Simpson: No way. I don't need any shrink, therapist, counselor, motivational speaker or "guru".
Colby: I'm a life coach.
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) Oh, tell me more!
Colby: (EXASPERATED NOISE) The first step in self-improvement is to take a thorough look at your life.

Homer Simpson: (BORED) Is this going somewhere?
Colby: What we have to do is figure a way to make "bowling alley Homer" into "everyday Homer".
Lenny Leonard: I have an aunt who became an uncle. Is it like that?
Colby: (IGNORING HIM, TO HOMER) I want you to wear those bowling shoes out the door and everywhere you go. It's crazy, but it just might work.

Marge Simpson: Oh Homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus.
Homer Simpson: (DIGGING IN) Mmmm, au jus! Not quite gravy, not quite blood...
Lisa Simpson: Look at the crowd around that table.
Bart Simpson: (GASP) It must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
Homer Simpson: Oh, I can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... (SHOCKED) elderly corpse?!!!
Lisa Simpson: (AGHAST) We crashed a funeral!
Marge Simpson: Oh my God! Oh my God! Quick, everyone put on their long faces!

Bart Simpson: Um, listen, I'm outta town next week, so...
Homer Simpson: Come on, we're leaving! (NOTICING) Mmm, after one more mini-quiche...

Dr. Julius Hibbert: Not dirt -- vegetables!
Homer Simpson: (SMUG) Which grow in what?

Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmm...
Homer Simpson: (TWO OPERATIC ANNOYED GRUNTS, ONE HIGH, ONE LOW)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Fascinating.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: When Homer is on his back, his stomach lodges perfectly under his diaphragm, giving him a powerful singing voice.
Bart Simpson: Is that a real thing?
Lisa Simpson: It is! Tenor Andrea Bocelli recorded an entire song on his back.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: You know, Homer, your singing could help alleviate patient suffering, and save us a fortune in Demerol.

Homer Simpson: Well I didn't mean to!

Homer Simpson: Wow, praise from Placido Domingo.
Placido Domingo: (FRIENDLY) Call me P-Dingo.
Homer Simpson: (UNCONVINCED) Eh, I'll think about it.
Placido Domingo: You know, Homer, there's one thing about opera that has always bugged me: everyone sings instead of talking. But you made me believe I was in a magical world where singing is talking.
Homer Simpson: Thanks! You know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! (THINKING) No wait, I forgot about that other guy. Sorry, you're third.
Placido Domingo: Wait, Homer, before you go, there's this new note I'm working on. Tell me what you think... (SINGS OPERATIC NOTE)

Marge Simpson: Homer, can't we please be alone? (SWEETLY) It's our anniversary.
Carl Carlson: We'll move to another table.

Homer Simpson: A lady motorcycle driver?! What is this, the Twilight Zone?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - later)
Beautiful Woman: It's a shame a few out of control fans can make the rest of us look bad.
Marge Simpson: I couldn't agree more, Julia.
JULIA: Listen, I love opera, but I hate the way these people treat your husband. Why don't you make me president of Homer's fan club and I'll keep the crazies in check.
Marge Simpson: That's a great idea! To celebrate, I'll go whip us up some Chex Mix pie.
Homer Simpson: So did you see the show tonight? Remember the part where I forgot the words and I just sang "Uh-oh Spaghetti-os". I'm hoping they send me a case.
JULIA: (QUICK BUT CALM) Now listen, Homer. You can have me any time you want me.
Homer Simpson: (CALLING, NERVOUS) Marge!

Marge Simpson: (CALLING) What is it, sweetie?
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS, CALLING) Um, everyone's wearing clothes in here.
Marge Simpson: That's nice!
JULIA: Mr. Simpson will send you a photo if you send him a self-addressed envelope. (PUNCHES PHONE) Mr. Simpson cannot sing at your daughter's birthday, but he will come for cake. (PUNCHES PHONE) Dedicate your shopping center? What's the anchor store? (LISTENS, THEN CONDESCENDING) I don't think so.
Marge Simpson: She's perfect! For the first time since you became an opera star I can finally relax.
Homer Simpson: Uh, I'm not sure she's workin' out.
Homer Simpson: (FED UP) That's it! Let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to Marge and you can never, ever have it. This opera's over when the fat man sings.
JULIA: All right, Homer. I understand perfectly. You shall never be mine.
Homer Simpson: That's good. You've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. Now, I think it would be best if you left.
Homer Simpson: (IMPLORING) Julia, wait!
JULIA: Yes?
Homer Simpson: Before you go, could you hire your own replacement? (LOUD WHISPER) But make sure she's not crazy like you.

Chief Wiggum: No can do, Marge. My first duty is to the season-ticket holders. But don't worry, I've got the entire opera house on a complete lockdown.
Chief Wiggum: We've got sharp shooters on the gargoyles...
Chief Wiggum: Inflatable Homer decoys in the seats...
Chief Wiggum: And to take out the biggest threat of all, we're pre-crashing the chandelier.
Homer Simpson: (SINGING OPERA)
Marge Simpson: (UNCOMFORTABLE MOAN) I'm so tense, I can't enjoy Count Almaviva serenading the intended bride of Dr. Bartolo. I just can't.
Lisa Simpson: I don't see anything suspicious... except someone is loudly unwrapping their candy.
Moe Szyslak: It ain't candy, it's a lamb chop wrapped in foil.
Bart Simpson: Hey mom, do all conductors carry poisoned blow-darts in their pocket?

Chief Wiggum: Okay, that's a wrap, people!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Luckily the sniper bullets stopped her heart from pumping the poison through her body long enough for the chandelier to squish it all out of her. With any luck, she'll be up and stalking within a week. (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: (TO JULIA) I'm sorry you got hurt, but you learned an important lesson. No one comes between me and my Homie.
JULIA: (EVIL) I'll get you for this, Marge! If it's the last thing I do! (NORMAL) Oh and I scheduled the cable guy to come on Wednesday between ten and two.
Marge Simpson: Oh but Wednesday's not good for me.
JULIA: (EVIL) I know, Marge. I know. (LONG EVIL LAUGH)
Chief Wiggum: Let's go, Hagliacci -- or should I say, Madame Butterface! (OFF EDDIE AND LOU'S LOOKS) What? What? I had two.

Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) And I know something much more fun I can do on my back.

Marge Simpson: Oh Homie, I'd forgotten that beautiful song you wrote for me.
Homer Simpson: Hazel! Your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw I ate after we first made love.
UNCLE ZACK: Milhouse, that was a perfect landing. Oh, did you remember to cut off the gas flow?
Milhouse Van Houten: The what?

Bart Simpson: Shut up! I don't love Milhouse.
Lisa Simpson: Oh really? The more you deny it, the more I know it's true.

Mr. Johnson: Hey, in the real world, rope climbing skills are vital!
Milhouse Van Houten: Goodbye, old life.

Comic Book Guy: And the cost of your innocent accident is...
Comic Book Guy: Twenty-five dollars, please.
Milhouse Van Houten: (LIP QUIVERING) But that's the money Yaya Sophia gave me for Greek Orthodox Easter.
Comic Book Guy: (SIGHS) I hate when they tell me things about themselves.
Bart Simpson: You should stop being so mean to us kids.
Comic Book Guy: (MOCKING) Well, I suppose you could buy your comics somewhere else. (POINTS OUTSIDE) Maybe they sell comics at the dry cleaners. No? Perhaps they sell comics at the mattress store. No? Or, perhaps you could buy your comics (DOUBLE TAKE) at that new comic book store across the street?!
Comic Book Guy: ("JESUS H. CHRIST") Philip K. Dick! It can't be! It is as if Superman moved to Gotham City!
Martin Prince: Which he did, in World's Finest Comics number ninety-four. See?
Comic Book Guy: (CORRECTING) That was an imaginary story -- dreamt by Jimmy Olsen after he was kicked in the head by Supergirl's horse, Comet. It never really happened!

Dan Clowes: (PROUDLY) This is where the Batman keeps his money in case he has to take the bus.
Lisa Simpson: Mm-hm.
Bart Simpson: Alan Moore, you wrote my favorite issues of Radioactive Man!
Alan Moore: Oh really. So you like that I made your favorite superhero a heroin-addicted jazz critic who's not radioactive?
Bart Simpson: I don't read the words. I just like when he punches people. How do you make his costume stick so close to his muscles?
Milhouse Van Houten: Mr. Moore, will you sign my DVD of "Watchmen Babies?"
Milhouse Van Houten: (HOLDING UP DVD) Which of the babies is your favorite?
Alan Moore: (GROWING FURY) You see what those bloody corporations do? They take your ideas and they suck them! Suck them like leeches until they've gotten every last drop of the marrow from your bones!

Homer Simpson: I pay ten dollars a tube for those!
Husband #2: That's why I drive a Bentley.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, I haven't decided what kind of new car to get.

Husband #3: Yeah, she'll be "trading up."
Husband #1: And they're not talking about cars.
Homer Simpson: Are you sure they're not talking about cars? Because those are car words.
Husband #1: Homer, we're all second husbands.
Husband #2: As soon as our wives hit it big, they dumped the fat old guys they were with and married us.
Husband #2: Yes!
Homer Simpson: Marge won't dump me. I'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down.
Husband #1: Mmm-hmm. Here's how it starts: she gets a total makeover and she starts wearing fancy new clothes.
Husband #2: Then she stops wanting to tell you about her day.
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED NOISE)

(Nurse's Station: Int. nurse's station - continuous)

Homer Simpson: Why is everything Hollywood makes so excellent? Whyyyy?

Keith Olbermann: (INDIGNANT) I was upgraded against my will! (COMPOSES HIMSELF) Look Marge, you think I'm handsome, don't you?
Marge Simpson: Of course.
Keith Olbermann: (IRATE) Well, it takes a team of twenty people to keep me that way! Without ad money, I'd look like a swamp monster from a child's nightmare!

Lisa Simpson: (SCARED GASP)
Wes Doobner: (WESTERN, BUT MENACING) Hello, Simpsons. (EVIL CACKLE)
Homer Simpson: Finally, some service. Now listen. We wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- Michigan or better.
Wes Doobner: (SIDESHOW BOB VOICE) Silence! You've all stumbled into my ingenious trap.
Lisa Simpson: That voice!
Lisa Simpson: That commercial was a trick -- specifically designed to lure our family here!
Lisa Simpson: And "Wes Doobner's World Famous Family Style Rib Huts" is actually an anagram!
Sideshow Bob: Welcome to "Sideshow Bob's World Famous Family Style Return!"
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAM) Sideshow Bob!
Sideshow Bob: And now you're all going to die -- just because you watched a television commercial!
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Next time a commercial comes on, I'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as I can.
Homer Simpson: (LOUD SCREAM)
Sideshow Bob: Before you die, perhaps you'd like to know how I engineered my ultimate revenge.
Homer Simpson: (IRATE) I'd like to know if Wes Doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.
Sideshow Bob: (ROLLS EYES) I'm Wes Doobner.
Homer Simpson: Mr. Doobner, I have a complaint: I work hard, and when I go out with my family, I expect a certain level of basic--
Sideshow Bob: Shut up! Now, since last we met...
Sideshow Bob: (SADLY) Oh dear -- Sideshow Bob, "hoist on his own petard."
Bart Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Oh great, here it comes -- all the boring things you've done since the last time you didn't kill us.
Lisa Simpson: (HURT) You never ask what we've been up to. (EXCITED) We went to the strawberry patch and I picked the most strawberries!
Sideshow Bob: Shut up! This time, to liven up my tale, I brought along some visual aides. Just call me... Slideshow Bob!
Homer Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) Nobody do it.
Sideshow Bob: Here, we see Krusty helping you escape my clutches in Rome. After that, my family and I fled to England, where I found work as a chimney brush.
Sideshow Bob: Here's Buckingham Palace...
Sideshow Bob: (APOLOGETIC) Sorry, there's a lot of these...
Sideshow Bob: Bear with me...
Bart Simpson: Yeah, yeah, we've all been to England. Is this going somewhere?
Sideshow Bob: (OMINOUS) I never stopped plotting my revenge.
Sideshow Bob: I snuck into America amidst a bunch of undocumented Canadian comedy writers for The Jimmy Kimmel Show, whatever that is.
Sideshow Bob: Then, it was merely a matter of constructing my trap...and producing the commercial that lured you to your dooms. Which, by the way, got me an offer to direct a feature.
Lisa Simpson: Which one?
Sideshow Bob: (A LITTLE ASHAMED) "The Hills Have Eyes Three: The Hills Still Have Eyes". (SINISTER) And now, the moment we've all been waiting for...
Homer Simpson: Finally, the ribs.
Sideshow Bob: You shall all perish in a tragic accident caused by a defective laptop battery, (OPENS LAPTOP) that will overheat, then explode, setting off this TNT.
Lisa Simpson: (TERRIFIED GASP)
Sideshow Bob: Let's not tarry -- As Shakespeare said, "If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere best it were done quickly."
Sideshow Bob: Power on...
Sideshow Bob: (LAUGHS)
Sideshow Bob: This time, I've made no mistakes.
Lisa Simpson: Actually, you made one. What Shakespeare really said was "'twere well it were done quickly."
Sideshow Bob: (SARCASTIC) Yes, I'm sure you've studied the Immortal Bard extensively under your (WITHERING) Miss Hoover.
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING OUT) Macbeth, act one, scene seven. Look it up!

Audience: (GASP)
District Attorney: (CONFIDENT) Okay, if he doesn't say "but" right now, we are home free.
Sideshow Bob: But...
District Attorney: Damn!
Sideshow Bob: ...I plead not guilty, by reason of insanity! Insanity caused by my persecution at the hands of this young boy.
Bart Simpson: Young? I'm the oldest kid in my class! By like two years.
Sideshow Bob: (DRAMATIC) For my first witness I call my father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, Senior.
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) Look, that's Sideshow Bob's mother -- Dame Judith Underdunk! She's the greatest classical actress of her generation.
Lenny Leonard: Dame Judith, you were brilliant in "Troilus and Cressida." Did they name the Toyota Cressida after the play, or the play after the car?
Sideshow Bob's Mother: (INDIGNANT, DRAMATIC) My son is on trial for his life.
Lenny Leonard: (WHISPERING) I'm sorry, I know this is a terrible time. So just answer quick.
Sideshow Bob's Mother: (CURT) Play first, then car.
Lenny Leonard: (GROANS) I just lost a thousand dollars.
Sideshow Bob's Father: (TO JURY) Robert was a peaceful boy, sickly and weak from a congenital heart defect.

Sideshow Bob's Father: But then that Simpson boy started tormenting him and he crossed over into dementia.
Sideshow Bob: To what degree was this dementia blown?
Sideshow Bob's Father: Full.
Jury: (GASPS)
Bart Simpson: Stop feeling sorry for him! He's a homicidal maniac! He deserves to fry!
Audience: (GASPS)
Sideshow Bob: You see? He knows I'm going through a rough patch, still he harangues me.
Bart Simpson: (SCARED NOISES)
Sideshow Bob: Who among you have not suffered at the hands of this demon scamp and felt the urge for retribution?
Luigi: He ordered prank pizzas to eight eight eight Poopy Pants Lane! Poopy Pants Lane ends in the seven-hundred block!
Cletus Spuckler: He mocked my folksy ways!
Homer Simpson: He cheats at Uno!
Bart Simpson: Bob's playing all of you like saps. This man's a killer!
Sideshow Bob: See how he accuses me -- at my very own trial! I can take no more! (FLUSTERED GASPING) I didn't want to use this, but you've left me no choice!
Sideshow Bob: Nitroglycerin! Everybody panic!
Audience: (PANICKY GASPS)
Bart Simpson: Yoink! Foiled again, freak!
Sideshow Bob: You don't understand! I... I... (NOISE OF GREAT PAIN)

Kent Brockman: And there we see Bob's grieving parents, his brother Cecil -- let out of prison for the occasion -- his widow, Francesca, and his son, Gino.

Bart Simpson: Oh my God, it's beautiful! (BEAT) Are you buying this?
Krusty the Clown: There's the kid who killed my best friend! (SOBS, THEN QUICK) Buy my DVD.
Marge Simpson: Bart, I know this is nuts, but try to look sad.
Bart Simpson: I'm not sad. I have nothing to be sad about. Nothing!
Marge Simpson: Well, I guess the rest of us should pay our respects.

(Springfield Sidewalk: ext. springfield sidewalk - early evening)
Bart Simpson: Stupid Sideshow Bob. Even when he's dead he wrecks my life. I hope he's in hell eating a barf burger.
Cecil Terwilliger: I once felt that way, too.
Bart Simpson: Hey, aren't you Bob's brother?
Cecil Terwilliger: Biologically, yes, but we never got along. He was always zigging when I zagged. That summer when he wanted to tour the castles of Italy, I wanted to tour the castles of France. So we went to Spain, a compromise that satisfied no one.
Bart Simpson: That's stupid. You talk like you're smart, but you're stupid.
Cecil Terwilliger: Anyway, I choose to remember Bob as the big brother who taught me to play "Botticelli."
Bart Simpson: Sounds boring.
Cecil Terwilliger: Oh, you'd love it! It's a guessing game in which one player adopts the guise of a noteworthy-- you're right, it is boring. But the only way you'll find happiness is by making your peace with Bob.
Bart Simpson: Well, I guess I could say goodbye.
Cecil Terwilliger: You'd better make it snappy. They're cremating him in thirty minutes. I'll be scattering his ashes over the castles of France! (SELF-SATISFIED CHUCKLE) Take that, ashes!
(Street: Ext. street - late afternoon)
Milhouse Van Houten: (UPBEAT) Hey Bart! You're on the front page of the paper.
Bart Simpson: I'm going to set things right. Wanna come with me?
Bart Simpson: (TRYING TO FAKE BOB OUT) Cool, I found a trapdoor that leads to an underground city. Here I go! (MAKES SQUEAKY NOISE, À LA TRAPDOOR)
Milhouse Van Houten: I would, but tonight my dad's taking me to the batting cage. (STOKED) He's gonna teach me to umpire! Check it out -- an official Major League ball/strike counter!
Milhouse Van Houten: Ball one, ball two, strike one... (LOOKING AROUND) Bart? Bart?
(Simpson Home: ext. SIMPSON house - evening)
Milhouse Van Houten: (FLIRTY) Hi, Lisa. (ALL BUSINESS) Hate to mix B with P, but your family owes me for two weeks.
Marge Simpson: Milhouse, have you seen Bart?
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart Simpson? I think he went to pay his respects to Sideshow Bob. Mind if I sit down for a second?
Milhouse Van Houten: My feet are killing me.
Lisa Simpson: Feet? Killing?! (GASP OF REALIZATION) We gotta save Bart!
Homer Simpson: Now?
Homer Simpson: But I'm getting a home perm!
Lisa Simpson: Now!
(Funeral Home: int. funeral home - continuous)
Bart Simpson: Bob, it's me, Bart. I came here to tell you I never meant for you to die. I just wanted you to go to jail and get beat up a lot. (SAD) Now everyone wishes I was dead...

Bart Simpson: Ahhhhh! Sideshow Bob!
Sideshow Bob: (MANIACAL LAUGH)
Sideshow Bob: (MENACING LAUGHTER)
(Simpson Car: INT. SIMPSON CAR - CONTINUOUS)
Lisa Simpson: Bob planned this from the beginning --
Homer Simpson: Uh-huh.
Lisa Simpson: He wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
Homer Simpson: Yes.
Lisa Simpson: He would never get a Shakespeare quote wrong --
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: His mother was a Shakespearean actress!
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah!
Lisa Simpson: His father is a doctor...
Homer Simpson: A doctor, huh?
Lisa Simpson: ...so when Bob collapsed in the courtroom...
Homer Simpson: I remember.
Lisa Simpson: ...his father could take that opportunity to inject Bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.
Homer Simpson: Uh-huh.
Lisa Simpson: It was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!
Homer Simpson: Are you done? 'Cause I've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.
Sideshow Bob: When they find your ashes, they'll think it's me. And I'll be far away with my loving family.
Sideshow Bob: It's the perfect crime.
Cecil Terwilliger: And it was my flawless performance as the grieving brother that sealed the deal.
Sideshow Bob: (ROLLS EYES) Yes, and "Hamlet" is all about Laertes.
Cecil Terwilliger: Would you please stop comparing me to Laertes!
Sideshow Bob: If the doublet fits...
Gino: (TRIUMPHANT LAUGHS)
Lisa Simpson: Stop that cremation!
Homer Simpson: (SNIFFS TWICE) Hey, what smells so good?
Sideshow Bob: Zeus's pimples!

Sideshow Bob: You're too late, Simpsons! (TRIUMPHANT LAUGH)
Homer Simpson: Eat hobo remains!
Sideshow Bob: (SPUTTERING NOISES)
Bart Simpson: (INSIDE COFFIN) Get me outta here. What are you doing? I can't breathe!
Homer Simpson: Marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins.
Chief Wiggum: Freeze, Sideshow Snobs! You're all under arrest. You have the right to remain silent, but I hope you don't -- it's a long way to jail, and I like to chitchat.
Sideshow Bob: Wait, I must know -- (TURNS TO LISA) how did you loosen the tiles of my mosaic of murder?
Lisa Simpson: I grew suspicious when I saw the casket had extra room built in for your feet.
Lisa Simpson: Why would your family pay all that extra money for the comfort of a dead man?
Sideshow Bob: Damn these glorious gunboats!
Bart Simpson: (SARCASTIC CLAPPING) Nice try, Bob -- but you didn't count on one thing.
Sideshow Bob: What's that?
Bart Simpson: You stink like my butt! (BIG LAUGH) Take him away!
Sideshow Bob: (FRUSTRATED MOAN) Oh why must I feed him straight lines?!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day - establishing)
Marge Simpson: Well, this time I think Sideshow Bob is finally locked up for good.
Homer Simpson: Yeah. The only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!

Homer Simpson: A "Forget-Me-Shot?" Never heard of it.
Moe Szyslak: (PROUD) That means it worked. No one ever remembers. That's why I made this video to explain the process.
Moe Szyslak: You start with a splash of Jaegermeister, then add sloe gin, Triple-Sec, Quadruple-Sec, gunk from a dog's eye, Absolut Pickle...
Homer Simpson: Mmm, pickle...
Moe Szyslak: The red stripe from Aquafresh...
Moe Szyslak: And the funniest ingredient... the venom of the Louisiana Loboto-moth.
Moe Szyslak: C'mon, sweetie.
Moe Szyslak: You stir it with a home pregnancy test till it turns "positive"...

Homer Simpson: All right. Let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly.
Homer Simpson: (SAD MOAN) How can I get my memory to work?
Memory Lisa: Declarative memory can be broken into two subsets: the episodic forms are stored in the neocortex, while the semantic ones are--

Lenny Leonard: Geez, Homer, I can't believe your plan actually worked.
Homer Simpson: What plan?
Carl Carlson: Your plan to make the surprise party a surprise again. Remember?
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - the previous night)
Homer Simpson: Marge put so much work into that party. The least I could do is be surprised. If only I could forget what happened today.
Moe Szyslak: I got just the drink to wipe your mind clean... the "Forget-Me-Shot." (TO LENNY AND CARL) Fellas, if you got anything that you want to say to Homer that he'll never remember, say it now.
Lenny Leonard: (QUICKLY) Blue pants make you look fat.
Carl Carlson: (PILING ON) I've never learned your kids' names.
Lenny Leonard: Your yard is unkempt.
Carl Carlson: It is obvious you're bald.
Lenny Leonard: Your thighs make noise.
Carl Carlson: I find your small hands attractive.
Moe Szyslak: I've spit in every drink I ever served you. (SPITS IN HOMER'S DRINK) Bottoms up!
Homer Simpson: Hmmm... The only problem is, I'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman. No doubt I'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. And that will make me want to jump off a-- (GASPS)
Homer Simpson: For the love of God, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce.
Lenny Leonard: (AMIABLE) Okay.
(PARTY BOAT: ext. party boat - night (end flashback))
Lenny Leonard: (AWED) Wow, I'm a genius. But there are still a few things I don't understand. Like why did Marge lie to Chief Wiggum about how she got that black eye?
Marge Simpson: Because I didn't want him finding out about the party. I mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring Sarah, and I just don't care for that woman.
Homer Simpson: And when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure I got here.
Patty Bouvier: Yeah, that must be it.
Selma Bouvier: You know, there's an after-party at the bottom of the ocean.
Selma Bouvier: This is good for two free drinks.
Homer Simpson: (IGNORING THEM) Hmmm... The only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
Bart Simpson: Because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Oh yeah.
Homer Simpson: (BABY TALK) Who's an angry dog? Who's an angry dog?
Duffman: Now who wants a beer? Ha-ha!
Duffman: To a man I'm happy to call my best friend Homer Simpsno! (CHECKS SCRIPT) Simpson! Dyslexia -- Duffman's secret shame.

Marge Simpson: I'm just really worried about your weight. Bart says that we got a call from NASA and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.
Homer Simpson: Marge, that was a joke!
Marge Simpson: (ANGUISHED) But it comes from a true place...

Homer Simpson: I don't know about you, but I don't want to live in a future where food is brought by (SNEERING) waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where I can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. I say we rebuild the Fast-Food District -- bigger and better than ever!

Mayor Joe Quimby: Then it's decided. (RAPS GAVEL) The bond issue will be part of our next scheduled election: the Springfield presidential primary.

Marge Simpson: Homer's perfect for me! Just look at this note: (OPENS NOTE, READS IT) "I miss you." Aww...
Prof. August: Actually, Marge, if I may deconstruct that letter... When he writes "I miss you," "I" is the subject and "you" is the object. You are his object.
Prof. August: He's paying for you? Like he owns you? I'm sorry, but that is oppression.
Prof. August: Marge, your assignment is to think about what I've said about your relationship.
Prof. August: (INTENSE) Before it's too late.

Prof. August: No! No! I need whale songs!
Prof. August: Marge, may I compliment your appearance?

Bart Simpson: I've been in trouble, but never like this. (SAD) Guess I'll go turn myself in.
Lisa Simpson: Uh... let's think about this. Martin's gone, but it was an accident. Ruining our lives won't bring him back.
Bart Simpson: (STUNNED) Lisa! You're saying we shouldn't tell the truth?
Lisa Simpson: (A LITTLE CRAZED) I'm saying this is worse than a million A-minuses!
Marge Simpson: So, how was your outside time?

Seymour Skinner: (PUTS CARD AWAY) Martin was a shy, awkward child who will never fulfill his promise to become a weird, unloved adult. The Audio-Visual Club has prepared a video tribute to their fallen associate.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (IRRITATED) Jimbo, stop that!
Bart Simpson: Usually when I do something bad, I feel good. But not this time. (BREAKING DOWN) Martin was like Jesus -- only real!
Lisa Simpson: (CLENCHED TEETH) Bart, keep it together. People are looking!
Lisa Simpson: Don't you weasel out on me!

Nelson Muntz: Oh, there is one other thing. I was up in Springfield National Park, you know, where Martin bit the big one? Found this bone tied to a string.
Nelson Muntz: Almost like someone was playing a prank on him.
Nelson Muntz: You like pranks, don't you, dingus?

Martin Prince: Malheureusement, I landed right next to a cougar's lair. He saw me as easy prey.
Martin Prince: I feared death was a certainty, until I was saved by simple physics.

2nd Ballerina: We can smoke the programs!
3rd Ballerina: I can smoke my hair!
4th Ballerina: Maybe there's gum under the seats!
Lisa Simpson: All right, that's enough!
Lisa Simpson: I want to talk about a horrible practice afflicting millions of Americans. For years we've known how dangerous it is. It stunts your growth. And it's marketed to children. I'm talking about ballet.
Patty Bouvier: I'll smoke to that!
Lisa Simpson: Ballet is unnatural and unfair to women. I shall now cast off the shoes of oppression!

Marge Simpson: And I realize it's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children.
Bart Simpson: Does that mean I can stop training to be a Mexican wrestler?
Homer Simpson: No!
Homer Simpson: Now practice preening to the crowd, El Guapo.

Grampa Simpson: Son, let this music take you to a time when girls were girls and a Hershey bar was as thick as a phone book -- (SUDDENLY FURIOUS) I'm sick of this song!
Grampa Simpson: (GRUMBLES) I don't like this one either -- too optimistic!

Mayor Joe Quimby: (WEARY) It was a rhetorical question.
Lisa Simpson: And I used rhetoric in my answer!
Mayor Joe Quimby: (WEARY SIGH) Let's just move on.
(Springfield Town Hall: int. city hall - moments later)
Mayor Joe Quimby: (TURNING LOCK) ...Twenty-seven to the left... and open.
Lisa Simpson: Where's all the money?
Mayor Joe Quimby: Why it's right...
Mayor Joe Quimby: Uh-oh. We spent all our money on that new slogan for Springfield.
Mayor Joe Quimby: (GETS IDEA) Um... what say you leave the cookies, and I pay you double next year?
Lisa Simpson: (POINTS TO BADGE ON CHEST) Sir, I didn't get this "skepticism" merit badge falling for promises like that.
Mayor Joe Quimby: If you don't give me those cookies, I'll pass a law forcing your organization to accept gay scout leaders.
Lisa Simpson: I would strongly support that measure.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Just give me those cookies!
Mayor Joe Quimby: Let go. This is a low point for my administration.

Mayor Joe Quimby: Really broke! I've been reduced to using this cheap novelty gavel.
Crowd: (LAUGHS)
Mayor Joe Quimby: Order! Order!
Homer Simpson: (HUMBLE) Homer Simpson. I know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. (SINCERE) And I'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we Americans come together.
Townspeople: (AGREEING SUPPORTIVE APPLAUSE)
Homer Simpson: So I say we roll up our sleeves, and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money.

Mayor Joe Quimby: ...a fake FEMA official scammed us out of twenty-five hundred dollars. We are now worse than broke.
Townspeople: (PANICKED HUBBUB)

Lisa Simpson: I've gone through the town's financial records, and it turns out there are millions in uncollected city taxes.
Mayor Joe Quimby: We shall collect each and every back tax owed! Everyone from...Comic Book Guy to...Milhouse. No one shall be spared!
Kent Brockman: Dozens of swindling deadbeats, as well as this respected reporter who made an honest mistake, have paid their back taxes, leaving only one outstanding debtor: country music star Lurleen Lumpkin! Seen here at the height of her fame.

Bart Simpson: (REMEMBERING) Oh, right. Dad was Colonel Homer and he wore that awesome suit and Lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! (SCRATCHING CHIN) But I forget how Mom felt about it...
Homer Simpson: Kids, marriage is like a car. Along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. With Lurleen I just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. Now let's return to watching the news.
Kent Brockman: Ms. Lumpkin owed fifty thousand dollars in back taxes. With penalties, interest and the celebrity resentment tax, that sum has grown to twelve million dollars. However, she's been missing for several years, since her career went into a downward spiral.
Homer Simpson: I told her not to go into one of those.
Lisa Simpson: Double ew!

Lurleen Lumpkin: Your honor, I would love to pay the money I owe, but country music changed, and I went out of style.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Objection! Speculating on the trajectory of trends in country music.
Judge Snyder: I'm going to allow it. Lurleen, the court orders you to make payments of a hundred dollars a week till such time as your music comes back in style or becomes appreciated for its camp value.
Judge Snyder: All right, what's the next case?
Bailiff: Judge, next we have a man who's suing his wife for not dressing sexy enough in "The Case Of The Horny Husband."
Judge Snyder: What the?
Bailiff: (EMBARRASSED) I thought if we acted like "The People's Court," some day we'd be "The People's Court." Well, a bailiff can dream, can't he?

(Courthouse Steps: ext. courthouse steps - later)
Bart Simpson: I don't get it, Lurleen -- how did you lose all your money? Did it go up your nose? Between your toes?
Lurleen Lumpkin: (SHAKES HEAD) Sadly, no. Most of my money went to my ex-husbands.
Homer Simpson: Boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks.
Lurleen Lumpkin: Well, from now on, the only thing I'm gonna be married to is my work.

Bart Simpson: Fine with me. Look, I packed you a bag.
Homer Simpson: Well... it might be cold outside.
Bart Simpson: No problem. I bought you a hat.
Homer Simpson: (PUTS ON HAT) Oh, I see. It's reverse psychology. Well in that case I'm not going and I'm not staying. And I'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling.

Bart Simpson: (TOUCHED) Awww... looks like we're partners. You're a scrappy little misfit, just like me... (LOUDLY, TO OTHER 4-H-ERS) Anyone want to trade? No reasonable offer refused. I'll take a chicken!
(Barn: Int. barn - a little later)
Mary: (SLIGHT COUNTRY ACCENT) Pullet, Bantam, Orpington, Pullet, Flemish Giant, Pullet, Leghorn...
Bart Simpson: Keep it down! I'm trying to feed my runt.
Mary: (ROLLS EYES) Here, I'll show you what to do.
Bart Simpson: I'm Bart, and this is my calf, Lulubelle.
Mary: Uh... you know that's a boy, right?
Bart Simpson: Oh. I thought she was peeing out of her nipple.
Mary: How 'bout you just call him "Lou?"
Bart Simpson: That's great, it rhymes with "moo"!
(Rural Road: ext. rural road - sunrise)
(COUNTY FAIR: EXT. County FAIR - day)
Bart Simpson: So, what do you think of my calf?
(CALF JUDGING TENT: int. calf judging tent - continuous)
4-h Judge: (CHUCKLES) Now son, I'm not here to judge.
4-h Judge: Eh, what? Oh, right. I am.
4-h Judge: Well, I don't know much about cows, but I think we have a winner!
Bart Simpson: You're the greatest cow in the world! I'm gonna be your friend forever!
Lisa Simpson: Bart... you do know what happens next.
Bart Simpson: Something happens next?
Cheddarbarrel: Son, your calf is gonna be taken to a feedlot...
Bart Simpson: Lots of feed, that sounds good.
Cheddarbarrel: ...then slaughtered.
Bart Simpson: (STUNNED) But he won! Why don't you kill the loser cows?
4-h Judge: Oh, we will. (UPBEAT) But your cow gets to go first!
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON house - kitchen - EVENING)
Bart Simpson: Mom, they're gonna kill Lou and make him into food and fringe vests for gay cowboys. Can we buy him back? Can we?
Marge Simpson: (SYMPATHETIC) Honey... we'd love to, but... a prize-winning bull is thousands of dollars.
Bart Simpson: Oh man.
Homer Simpson: Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow.

Bart Simpson: (SITS UP) Lou?
Cow: (MOO)
Bart Simpson: Oh man, now I feel so bad I'm imagining I hear your voice.
Cow: (ANGRY MOO)
Bart Simpson: Leave me alone! It's not my fault there's nothing good to eat on this planet except meat!
Cow: (BIG MOURNFUL MOO)
Bart Simpson: I can't help you! I'm just a little boy! (SOBS)
Lisa Simpson: (ENTERS) Bart, are you all right?
Bart Simpson: I hear Lou mooing in my head!
Lisa Simpson: What you heard was your conscience telling you to stop eating meat.
Bart Simpson: If I could save Lou, I'd never eat meat again. Not even prosciutto and melon!
Chicken: (CLUCKING)
Bart Simpson: "Anguished Animals III?" That wasn't my conscience mooing -- it was (LOOKS CLOSER AT CD) Tress MacNeille!
Lisa Simpson: (SHEEPISH LAUGH) All right, so I put that there to get you to stop eating meat. But your body is going to miss the protein. So you'll have to take these pills.
Bart Simpson: Sorry Lis, I can't be a vegetarian -- I love the taste of death! But please, help me get my cow back.
Lisa Simpson: Okay. Meet me halfway -- stop stirring your lemonade with a sausage.
Bart Simpson: (TORN) Give me a minute.
Lisa Simpson: Come on.
Bart Simpson: (ANGUISHED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: It's a no-brainer.
Bart Simpson: (THIS WAS HARD) Okay.
(FEEDLOT: ext. feedlot - night)
Bart Simpson: Aw, man. I never figured the gate would be locked. It's like they knew we were coming.
Lisa Simpson: Don't worry. I called some animal activists who can help us get in. I'll just give the signal. (CALLS OUT) Milk is murder!
Voice: (CALLING BACK) Cheese is genocide!
ACTIVIST: (TO LISA) Good to see you, Windsong.
Bart Simpson: (SCORNFUL) Windsong?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, it's my code name. (RE: ACTIVISTS) This is Compost. And this is Solarpanel.
Bart Simpson: What's my code name?
Solarpanel: (LONG MURMURED CONFERRING)
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART) "Lisa's Brother."
Bart Simpson: (MOANS)
COMPOST: Forgive us for this violation, Mother Fence. We honor your chain-link spirit.
Bart Simpson: (CALLING) Lou! Lou!
Bart Simpson: Lou! Where are you, little buddy?
Cow: (MOO OF RECOGNITION)
Bart Simpson: (IN DISBELIEF) Lou? What happened to you? You got fat!
Lisa Simpson: Of course he did. His food is laced with growth hormones.
Bart Simpson: I don't care how much of a pumped-up freak you are, I still love you. The way Barry Bonds's kids probably still love him.
Lisa Simpson: (STRAINING) Come on!
(Stuff-N-Hug: int. Stuff-N-Hug - continuous)
Bart Simpson: How are we gonna get him out of here? (SEES SOMETHING, GASPS)
Lisa Simpson: Wow, you did learn a lot at 4-H.
Bart Simpson: Hell, yeah!
Cow: (DOPPLER MOO)
Bart Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) That was a practice cow.
Cows: (BORED LISTLESS MOOS)
(Country Road: ext. country road - dawn)
Bart Simpson: What are we gonna do with him?
Lisa Simpson: Well, your friend Mary from 4-H lives on a farm -- Lou can stay with her!
Bart Simpson: (CONSIDERING) Hmmm, a cow on a farm... With a moo moo here, and a moo moo there... (FULL VOICE) Yes, it works!
Bart Simpson: All right, Lou! To freedom! (BEAT) Lou?
Lou: (BORED MOO)
(RURAL FARM: ext. rural farm - day)
Cletus Spuckler: Howdy. What's yours that mines is Cletus?
Bart Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART) He wants to know your name.
Bart Simpson: Oh, I'm Bart Simpson. Is Mary here?
Cletus Spuckler: Hang on. (CALLING INTO THE HOUSE) Hey, Mary! There's a boy here askin' on you!
Mary: (FRIENDLY) Hey, Bart.
Bart Simpson: I didn't know Cletus was your dad.
Cletus Spuckler: (PROUDLY) She had a regular city birth in a gas station!
Bart Simpson: The feedlot wants to kill Lou and I can't keep him. Can I give him to you?
Cletus Spuckler: (EXTREMELY EXCITED GASP, THEN) Brandine! A young feller just offered Mary a cow!
Brandine Del Roy: Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God! Oh-my-God!
Lisa Simpson: (PUZZLED) What's going on?
Brandine Del Roy: Accordin' to the traditions of the hill folk, by giving our daughter a cow, you've made a formal proposal of marriage!
Bart Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP)
Cletus Spuckler: This calls for a hoedown.
Cletus Spuckler: Blow her a song of love!
Cletus Spuckler: Whoa! I said love, not lust!
(SPUCKLER FARM: EXT. SPUCKLER FARM - moments later)
Bart Simpson: I can't get married -- I'm only ten!
Mary: And I have dreams. I got fifteen-eighty on my D.Q.A.T.
Bart Simpson: D.Q.A.T.?
Mary: Dairy Queen Aptitude Test. (PROUDLY) Eight hundred ice cream, seven-eighty Brazier.
Brandine Del Roy: Somethin' burrowed...
Brandine Del Roy: And somethin' stew.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I'll find a way to get you out of this wedding. In the meantime, just say yes, so Lou will be safe -- look how happy he is.
George W. Bush: I wish I had a tail what did swat away flies. Mine just hangs there.
Bart Simpson: All right, sir, I'll marry your daughter.
Brandine Del Roy: We're gonna have us the fanciest weddin' in the county! Cletus! Open up a wall so Dia-Betty can come!
Dia-Betty: (AFFECTIONATE) Just bring 'em to a window so I can pinch 'em.
Cletus Spuckler: We always figured someday Mary would marry -- that's why we called her "Mary". We name all our kids after what we think's gonna happen to 'em. Ain't that right, Stabbed-in-jail?
Stabbed-in-jail: (CHEERFUL) We'll see who stabs who.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - kitchen - day)
Homer Puppet: Doot de-doo de-doo do-doo de-doo... (GASP) Strained spinach?! I'm not going to eat that -- it's yucky!
Marge Puppet: Yo! I'm the coolest puppet in Sockville, and I love strained spinach!
Homer Puppet: Really? I guess I'll try it then.
Homer Puppet: Mmm-mm-mm! I wonder if Maggie would like it.
Lisa Simpson: Mom! Dad! Bart's marrying one of Cletus' daughters!
Marge Simpson: We're putting a stop to this right now!
Lisa Simpson: Wait! If you stop the wedding, Bart's cow will die! And he really cares about that cow... and Bart doesn't usually care about stuff, so... help.
Marge Simpson: (THINKS, THEN) All right, I've got an idea -- but it'll take a lot of sewing.
Lisa Simpson: I'll get your fabrics!
Homer Simpson: And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.
Ned Flanders: Ow! What was that for?
Homer Simpson: Bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!
Ned Flanders: (UPBEAT) Zippin' it up! (CHUCKLES, THEN MIMES ZIPPING HIS LIPS SHUT)
(SPUCKLER FARM: ext. spuckler farm - day)
Head Caterer: Okay, let's set up the chitlin bar over here... Uh, start drizzling the crawdad reduction on the possum pouches... And excuse me, why are the spittoons so far from the chaw station? This is a wedding, people! Not a funeral!
(SPUCKLER HOUSE: int. spuckler house - continuous)
Brandine Del Roy: Here you go, sweetheart. Somethin' old...
Brandine Del Roy: Somethin' new...
Mary: Mama, you know I love your Somethin' Stew, but I got no appetite for any of this.
Brandine Del Roy: Aw, you just got cold feet - 'cause you barefoot and our floor's made of mud.
Bart Simpson: (URGENT) Have you seen my sister?
Mary: No, and she's cutting it pretty close... we're about ten minutes away from "You may kiss the bride."
Bart Simpson: (HORRIFIED) Kiss?! I thought we were just getting married!
(SPUCKLER FARM: ext. spuckler farm - wedding area - five minutes later)
Country Preacher: Do you, Bart Simpson, take Mary Wrestlemania Spuckler to be your lawful wedded wife, for as long as you both shall reckon?
Bart Simpson: (SWALLOWS) I do.
Country Preacher: (NODS APPROVINGLY, THEN RE: MARY) And since we don't need to hear from womenfolk what they think, I now pronounce you--
Marge Simpson: Stop the wedding!
Hillbilly Guests: (IN UNISON SHOCKED HILLBILLY GULP)
Marge Simpson: Bart is a ten-year-old boy. He still sits in the driveway and pretends to drive the car.
Hillbilly Guests: (CRACK UP)
Bart Simpson: Mom, I have to do this! I love that big ol' cow!
Mary: (HURT) How could you say that?! I starved myself to get into this dress!
Bart Simpson: (REASSURING TO MARY, QUICKLY) No, no, no, no, no -- you look great, honey. (TURNS TO MARGE) Mom, if I don't get married, they'll take Lou.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, Bart. But sometimes your mom knows best.
Cletus Spuckler: Son, I'm afraid hillbilly law is clear: if this marriage is off, then that cow is goin' back to the feed lot and Mary must taste the bitter agony of being an old maid of eleven.
Brandine Del Roy: Don't feel bad, sweetie. I was thirteen when I married your father.
Cletus Spuckler: Yeah, and you'd already been divorced four times.
(Rural Road: ext. rural road - front of spuckler farm - a little later)
Bart Simpson: (SAD) Goodbye, Lou. I'll never forget you.
Cow In Truck: (SAD MOO)
Bart Simpson: Mom, how could you do this to me?
Marge Simpson: (KINDLY) Sweetie, don't you think your Mom might have a trick up her sleeve?
Bart Simpson: No.

Marge Simpson: Okay, have fun at the Laughter House. Now I'll just turn off my phone to save the battery.
(Springfield Airport: ext. springfield airport - a little later)
Bart Simpson: (SINCERE) Great plan, Mom. But where is Lou gonna go?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Don't worry, Bart -- in India, your cow will be treated like a God and receive the food and medical care that in America would go to human beings.
Bart Simpson: Lou, if that plane leaves the ground and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and definitely after they kill you and make you into sloppy Joes.
Bart Simpson: Here's looking at you, cud.
Marge Simpson: Okay Lisa, I'm turning my phone back on to see if your father is ready to be picked up. (TURNS ON PHONE) Huh, I have over four hundred text messages.

Homer Simpson: Marge... kids... the things I saw. It makes me never wanna eat meat again...
Homer Simpson: Just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on Fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human.
Lisa Simpson: For you, Dad -- I consider that a victory.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - night)
Bart Simpson: You're in a better place now, Lou. I'll always be proud for once in my life... I had a cow, man.

Bart Simpson: (YAWNS) Why do we have to get here so early? The football game doesn't start for hours.
Homer Simpson: (HAPPY CHUCKLE) We're not here for the game. The game is nothing. The game is crap. (GETTING ANGRY) The game makes me sick!
Homer Simpson: The real reason we Americans put up with sports, is for this...
(SPRINGFIELD STADIUM: ext. springfield stadium - parking lot - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Behold, the tailgate party -- the pinnacle of human achievement!
Homer Simpson: (LOFTY) Since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. What childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged.
Homer Simpson: (DREAMY SIGH, TO KIDS) What could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?
Lisa Simpson: (DRYLY) Anything?
Bart Simpson: No, everything is better.
Bart Simpson: Anything! / Everything! / Anything! / Everything!
Ralph Wiggum: Daddy, I made a Ralphwich!
Ralph Wiggum: (CONFUSED) It tastes hurty!
Chief Wiggum: (SIGHS, THEN SNAPPING) That's 'cause it's not food, Ralphie!
Chief Wiggum: (IMMEDIATELY REMORSEFUL) No, no, no, I'm sorry. It's food, it's food. Everything's what you say it is.
(Simpson Car: Ext. Simpson car - elsewhere)
Homer Simpson: All right, time to dig in. I brought everything we need.
Bart Simpson: It's just forks and plates. Didn't we bring any food?
Homer Simpson: The food is all around us.
Bart Simpson: You brought us here to beg?
Homer Simpson: Up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching.
Homer Simpson: (OVERJOYED) Moleman! Come here, ya big bag-a skin! How the hell are ya, huh?!
Hans Moleman: (MUFFLED NOISES)
Homer Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS) Yeah? No kidding? Well, that sounds like you're gonna have fun.
(Parking Lot: EXT. parking lot - elsewhere)
Carl Carlson: Springfield U sucks!
Sideshow Mel: A and M cheerleaders are clumsy!
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry, but as a filmmaker I have to face the truth.
Carl Carlson: Your superstar professors treat undergrads like an afterthought!
Sideshow Mel: Your tenure track is heavily politicized!
Carl Carlson: Oh, that's it!
(Near Simpson Car: ext. near simpson car - day - half an hour later)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, honey, just because you're a girl doesn't mean you can't join in the fun. Maggie and I are washing the soiled foam fingers.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I guess I could cut loose and do a little homework.
Lisa Simpson: I can start working on my school video project. The assignment is to film the beauty of the everyday. So let's see...
(SPRINGFIELD STADIUM: ext. springfield stadium - parking lot - later)
Lisa Simpson: There's drama and inspiration everywhere I look.
Lisa Simpson: I am a born filmmaker!
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - day - establishing)
Mr. Kinkaid: Really interesting stuff. Three points out of a possible five.
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS FAKE LAUGHTER) Oh, that's a funny joke, Mr. Kinkaid. Is this an art class or a comedy class? (QUICK, GRIM) Seriously, why is it three?
Mr. Kinkaid: (ALL BUSINESS) I can make it a two.
Lisa Simpson: (RESPECTFUL) Three it is! You're the teacher, and I accept your decision.
(Skinner's Office: int. skinner's office - day)
Lisa Simpson: The man is an idiot!
Seymour Skinner: Agreed. The film has everything -- emotion, conflict, Milhouse! Lisa, you're a gifted filmmaker. It's as if Ingmar Bergman and Penny Marshall had a baby.
Lisa Simpson: Principal Skinner, I didn't know you knew so much about film.
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLE) Cinema is my secret passion. I've even written a screenplay or two (BRAGGING) "on speculation."
Seymour Skinner: (READING) "When Edna Met Seymour"... "Ghost Willie"... "Killing Seymour's Mother"... "The Principal Who Sold A Screenplay"...
Lisa Simpson: (BEING POLITE) They sound great... I'd love to read them sometime.
Seymour Skinner: Unfortunately, the studios have made it clear they're not interested in my work. In fact, I'm... I'm no longer welcome on the Universal Studios tour.
Lisa Simpson: Orlando or Hollywood?
Seymour Skinner: There's one in Hollywood?!
Lisa Simpson: (IMPATIENT) Yeah. Getting back to my grade...
Lisa Simpson: (GUILTY NOISE)
Seymour Skinner: Forget grades! With the right subject, you could be a great filmmaker. What comes to mind when you think of drama?
Lisa Simpson: Well, according to Aristotle, drama contains six elements: plot, theme, character--
Seymour Skinner: Not the smarty-pants answer. Where's the drama in your life?
Lisa Simpson: Okay, but can I just finish the smarty-pants answer?
Seymour Skinner: No! In your life!
Lisa Simpson: (QUICKLY) My family. (THEN QUICKLY) ...Language, rhythm and spectacle.
Seymour Skinner: Family, eh? That's right, your brother is Bart Simpson, one of Mrs. Krabappel's fourth graders. And your father is a local character of note.
Seymour Skinner: Lisa, if you make a documentary about your family, I can help you.
Seymour Skinner: I'm giving you... the key to the A.V. cage.
Lisa Simpson: (IMPRESSED GASP) This is so generous. How can I ever repay you?
Seymour Skinner: (SINCERE) All I ask is, if you ever win an Oscar... give it to me.
Lisa Simpson: Um, okay.
Seymour Skinner: (SATISFIED SIGH) Those cabinet makers laughed at me, (INTENSE) but they'll see.
(Simpson Home: INT. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, what are you doing?
Lisa Simpson: (UPBEAT) I'm making a documentary about a very special family.
Bart Simpson: Smithers and Burns?
Lisa Simpson: No, us!
Homer Simpson: Can I be Smithers?
Lisa Simpson: No Dad, I want you to play Homer Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (HURT) Why, 'cause I'm fat?
Marge Simpson: I love documentaries! Especially the one that came with our lawnmower.
Marge Simpson: Although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.
Lisa Simpson: Okay everyone -- just be yourself. Don't look in the camera, pretend I'm not here, and... (SIGHS, POINTEDLY) no toupees...
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) What, I'm going for a Shia LaBeouf thing. Not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... Shia LaBeouf!
Lisa Simpson: And... let's roll.
Homer Simpson: Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.
Marge Simpson: (LAUGHING) Homie, she's not making a snuggle film. (KISSES HIM)

Gary Chalmers: I hear you've been encouraging a student's creativity!
Seymour Skinner: (DEFENSIVE) Please sir, I can explain...
Gary Chalmers: I'm thrilled! Or would have been, if not for your knee-jerk assumption that I'm angry at you -- which I am now! Anyway, we have got to support Lisa Simpson's film. This is our chance to finally show up that fancy Springfield Creative Arts Academy.
Gary Chalmers: The whole school is made up of modeling clay -- every afternoon they reshape it, just to get my goat.
Seymour Skinner: Well, with some school band music and added effects, we could show Lisa's film at the public library.
Gary Chalmers: Think bigger, Seymour. Think film festivals.
Seymour Skinner: You mean... Banff?
Gary Chalmers: Banff, shmanff! I'm talking about Sundance!
Seymour Skinner: Sundance, the preeminent independent film festival held each January in Park City Utah?
Gary Chalmers: Uh yes, the very same, yes. If Lisa's movie gets in, we won't just be the school with the highest hamster mortality rate.
Gary Chalmers: Ah, so young. We'll also have a kid who did a thing!
Dewey Largo: I call this cue "Homer's Lament."
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - outside classroom - day)

Homer Simpson: Who are you?
Jim Jarmusch: I try to answer that question in my films.
Homer Simpson: What else?
Jim Jarmusch: I can eat a raw onion without crying.
Homer Simpson: Prove it, Hollywood!
Homer Simpson: Hey, you're crying!
Jim Jarmusch: Yeah, but I'm crying about something else.
Homer Simpson: What?
Jim Jarmusch: This is the last time we'll ever be together.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: These badges will get us into any of the independent movies playing at Sundance.
Marge Simpson: (RE: MARQUEE) Ooo, "Regularsville." Sounds like my kind of place!
Marge Simpson: (HORRIFIED NOISE, THEN NOTICING) Ooo, "Candyland." A great family game is now a great family movie!

Lisa Simpson: I didn't mean it like that! A lot of things got changed in the editing room.
Lisa Simpson: (HAPPILY) Proudly edited by Lisa Simpson!
Bart Simpson: Lisa, your movie exposed our crappy side to the world. I knew you were lame, (SERIOUS) but I never imagined you were bogus.
Marge Simpson: Sweetie, I'm usually your number one fan. But, call me old-fashioned, I usually don't like movies that humiliate my family in front of the world.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, I was just trying to accurately portray my unique and quirky home life.
Homer Simpson: Quirky? Quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! You made us look like monsters!
Bart Simpson: Monsters! Monsters! Monsters!
Lisa Simpson: Guys, guys! Look, it's a documentary -- nobody outside of this festival is ever gonna hear about it.
Comic Book Guy: "Lisa Simpson's unflinching, darkly comic family portrait is the can't-miss hit of the festival. Landspeeder, do not Bantha, to your nearest cinema to see Lisa Simpson stab her family in the back with her camera."
Homer Simpson: Don't you dare post that review.
Comic Book Guy: I'm sorry. You're too late. I have just hit enter, sending the wi-fi beams along their way.

Seymour Skinner: Well, if we can't get into Sundance, would you like to check out its alternative cousin, Slam Dance?
Gary Chalmers: I'd rather die.
Agent: There they are -- the producers of "Capturing The Simpsons!"
Executive: Your movie's great! We want to be in the Chalmskinn business!
Gary Chalmers: This is it, Seymour -- the big deal. Just play it cool.
Agent: Look, we want to buy this movie. And we're prepared to offer you anything.
Seymour Skinner: We're prepared to accept anything!
Executive: Name your price.
Seymour Skinner: We want ten percent of the first-dollar gross, full European distribution rights, and access to the most exclusive VIP tent in Sundance.
(CHILI TENT: int. chili tent - day)
Gary Chalmers: (IMPRESSED) Way to make a deal, Seymour!
Seymour Skinner: They don't even know that my pockets are full of bottled water and cornbread!
Gary Chalmers: (LAUGHS, THEN) Yes.
People On Street: (WHISPERING) It's them! / Look at them walking around! / They're so creepy!
Woman On Street: (CALLING) Say something dysfunctional!
Man On Street #2: Let me get a picture of you strangling my kid!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) No.
Man On Street #2: Hey, we pay your salary.
Homer Simpson: (SAD SIGH) I never wanted to be famous for being mean. I wanted to be famous for catching Santa Claus.
Bart Simpson: (DEPRESSED MOAN) Let's just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it's nice for the next people.
Lisa Simpson: I can't believe what I've done -- maybe deep down I always knew how much this film would hurt them. Maybe I'm the monster this movie exposed.
Voice: Now what kind of talk is that?
Lisa Simpson: Oh... hi, Mr. Jarmusch.
Jim Jarmusch: Lisa, I've been following your family's turmoil closely, and I can relate. My movies like "Stranger Than Paradise" and "Down By Law" are also about social misfits experiencing the dark side of the American dream. I'm doing it again in my next film, "Cheaper By The Dozen 3."
Lisa Simpson: That doesn't sound like your kind of movie.
Jim Jarmusch: It will be. Check out the poster.
Lisa Simpson: Ew... so, do you think my family will ever forgive me for making them a laughing stock?
Jim Jarmusch: The answer to that is where it always is -- in a movie. Let's take a look.
(Theater: int. theater - moments later)
Lisa Simpson: Nelson? He couldn't have made a movie by himself. Who helped him?
Announcer: (WHISPER VOICE) Chalmskinn...
Seymour Skinner: (SHRUGS) Seymour Skinner never puts all his eggs in one basket. That's why they call me "Two Basket" Skinner. (OFF HER LOOK) What? They do.
Nelson Muntz: I'm Nelson. This is my house.
Nelson Muntz: This is the impound lot that my house gets towed to every night.
Mrs. Muntz: Let's get goin' -- we got to swing by the Laundromat, steal me a new bra.
Nelson Muntz: You're gonna be the classiest girl at Classy Girls!
Jim Jarmusch: (TO SCREEN) No, no, no, don't go in there! Oh no, he did! Oh man, that is messed up! (SEES SOMETHING) Whoa, what the hell is that?
Lisa Simpson: (WHISPERS) It's just a cat.
Jim Jarmusch: What? Oh yeah, oh yeah, now I see it.
Nelson Muntz: Mom, there's this school play tonight. It's called "Kids Are People Too," and I play a grownup who doesn't think kids are people too. (SCUFFING GROUND, SHY) So, if you wanna come...
Mrs. Muntz: Can't -- I'm organizing my Laramie Bucks. If I want that golf umbrella, I got to get to smokin'.
Nelson Muntz: Sometimes I take the long way home, past the happy people's houses. I like to look inside and pretend I have a family like theirs.
(Nelson's Trailer: int. nelson's trailer - later)
(Beach: ext. beach - later)
Nelson Muntz: I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.
Lisa Simpson: Thank you, Mr. Jarmusch -- you've taught me a valuable lesson that other people have bigger family problems than I do.
Jim Jarmusch: True, but I was also teaching you that festival buzz is, like my movie "Coffee and Cigarettes", a funny thing. Did you see it?
Lisa Simpson: Well, I uh...
Jim Jarmusch: (CUTTING HER OFF) That's okay, I know you did.
Male Filmgoer: I like this movie way better than the one by that little girl -- 'cause I saw this one today!
Lisa Simpson: Wow, I guess Nelson's the hot thing now. My movie will probably never be seen.
Jim Jarmusch: Oh, it will -- on select flights by Alaska Airlines and its regional partners. Okay, only its regional partners. The point is, you made a great movie and you ought to be proud.
Jim Jarmusch: And now, like the best independent films, I must fade out with a cool dissolve.
Jim Jarmusch: (PAINED/WHINY WHILE DISSOLVING) Owwwwwwwwww! That hurt!
(Theater: ext. theater - continuous)
Man On Street: Hey Nelson, say something poor!

Marge Simpson: No more Simpsons movies! One was plenty!
Lisa Simpson: Are you guys still mad at me?
Marge Simpson: We know you love us, honey -- even though sometimes you show it in a "quirky" way.
John C. Reilly: I'm not gonna lie to you guys -- John C. Reilly would love to be in the ChalmSkinn business.
Seymour Skinner: Well, did you read my script?
John C. Reilly: Read it? I lived it! I am Ghost Willie. Check this out -- (CRAZY GHOST NOISES)

Carl Carlson: So, what are you doing?
Moe Szyslak: I like creating disappointment. You know that little moment where people's hope dies? I feed on that.
Driver: Uh, is this space free?
Moe Szyslak: (OPENING DOOR, UPBEAT) You know, as a matter of fact... (SLAMS DOOR) it ain't.
Driver: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Moe Szyslak: (SATISFIED SIGH) Aw, that's Heaven.

Lisa Simpson: I wanna go lecture the food court businesses that are still using Styrofoam!
Bart Simpson: Lead-based toys! Lead-based toys!
Homer Simpson: Sit on a bench! Sit on a bench!
Maggie Simpson: (RAPID SUCKS AS SHE POINTS)
Marge Simpson: For once, we'll do what Maggie wants.
Bart Simpson: (MOANS, THEN WHINY) Maggie's thing? She won't even remember that we did it!

Homer Simpson: Mom!
Ned Flanders: My aquarium!
Mona Simpson: (SWEETLY) Hello, Homer.
Homer Simpson: You're alive! And you baked a pie!
Marge Simpson: Homie, what's going on?
Homer Simpson: I'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!
Homer Simpson: Mom, I can't believe you're here. You keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. You're just like that show "Scrubs".
Mona Simpson: Homer, I'm sorry I had to pretend to be dead. But it worked, because the government isn't looking for me anymore. I can finally stop running and be your mom.
Homer Simpson: (STIFFLY) No thanks.
Mona Simpson: (STARTLED) What do you mean?
Homer Simpson: Every time you go, I feel abandoned. But not this time. I'm not gonna let myself get hurt.
Mona Simpson: Homer, I'm through protesting and chaining myself to things. I've realized that the most important thing in my life is you.
Homer Simpson: That's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. In fact, I don't even want your pie.
Mona Simpson: You already ate the whole thing.
Homer Simpson: Well I'm not going to digest it!
Lisa Simpson: Wow, Dad was so cute as a baby.
Bart Simpson: When did he lose his cuteness?
Mona Simpson: Oh, I have a picture of that right here.
Lisa Simpson: (SHUDDER)
Mona Simpson: I do feel bad for missing so much of Homer's childhood. But at least he wasn't raised by a television...
(Abe and Mona's House: int. abe and mona's house - flashback)
Young Mona: See you later, honey -- Mommy has to go chain herself to a nuclear submarine. Hugs and kisses!

Homer Simpson: (SAD) Oh, I don't even care.
Mona Simpson: (STICKING HEAD IN) Homer, are you okay?
Homer Simpson: (POUTY) I'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.
Mona Simpson: Sweetheart, when I left you, it was because I thought I could make the world a little bit better. Maybe all I did was make my own world a lot worse. I only hope you can forgive me.
Homer Simpson: No! I can't forgive you -- and I don't accept your tuck-in!
Mona Simpson: (HURT) I understand -- these things take time. Goodnight.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) I feel terrible. My own mother reached out to me, and I rejected her. I'm gonna make her a card.
Homer Simpson: Mom?

Marge Simpson: (WHISPERS) Say something comforting.
Bart Simpson: Okay, comforting, comforting... (GENUINE) Uh Dad, whenever I would hang out with Grandma, she would always ask me about you. And I'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) She said I didn't suck?

Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon: (UPBEAT, CONFIRMING) Yes, I will.
Homer Simpson: I mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? Does she know I feel bad about things I said?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Well, perhaps she's around us now. She may have already been reincarnated as... (POINTS) that newborn baby, or that tiny mouse in the nacho cheese...
Ned Flanders: Oh for crying out loud -- people aren't mice!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (SARCASTIC) Oh, what a surprise -- Joe Jesus Junior is gonna set us all straight.
Ned Flanders: Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it.
Homer Simpson: (RESIGNED) That's it. (SAD SIGH)
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: That's the thing with your religion -- it's a bummer.

Mona Simpson: Hello, Homer. If you are watching this right now, I am dead. Or, if I'm not dead, you've gotten into my stuff. But if I am dead, this is my will. And if I'm not, get out of my stuff.
Mona Simpson: To my grandson Bart, I leave my Swiss army knife. (HOLDS UP SWISS ARMY KNIFE, THEN PUTS IT DOWN)
Bart Simpson: Cool.

Lisa Simpson: (TOUCHED) Grandma, I accept your gift.
Bart Simpson: You got nothing! You got nothing!
Mona Simpson: Marge, I have a purse for you. It's woven out of nature's most amazing material, hemp.

Homer Simpson: (DRAMATIC) I always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me.

C. Montgomery Burns: Hey, I've seen your wife. She's no Mamie Van Doren.
Homer Simpson: Just what are you guys up to?

Homer Simpson: The rainforest?! That's that thing Lisa likes!
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, maybe she'll like it better filled with dying trees and mutated animals.

Theater Actor: This year's nominees are an eclectic group...
Sideshow Mel: This distinguished-looking gentleman is a highly-respected actor. It's not important what he says, or who he's a parody of. Only one person here really matters -- the recipient of this award.
Sideshow Mel: No, it is not me. I am but your humble narrator in this tale of fame, betrayal and coin collecting. But more about that later.

What I love about Krusty is, he's always on... but to find out what, you've gotta test his pee!

Drew Carey: Seriously, test his pee. He's a danger to the community. And now I give you a man whose act will never grow old, because it started out that way (CHUCKLES): Krusty the Clown!
Krusty the Clown: Thank you. I never thought I'd make it past four hundred episodes -- what with the drinking and the smoking and the fact that I'm just not that good. It seems like just yesterday that we started the show, with the original Krusketeers!

Bart Simpson: "E.T."
Bart Simpson: "B.E.T."
Lisa Simpson: (APPLAUDING) Yay, Bart!
Marge Simpson: My son's a good-for-something!
Krusty the Clown: (TO NELSON) What are you lookin' at?
Krusty the Clown: Uh, yeah, okay. (TO ALL KIDS) You kids were all terrific! I wish I could make each of you a Krusketeer, but we only have enough money for one. Plus, I don't really want to. So after much consideration of all your talents...my new Krusketeer is...
Krusty the Clown: What's your kid's name again?
Mrs. Muntz: Nelson Muntz!
Krusty the Clown: Wilbur Mudd!
Nelson Muntz: That's me! Here's Mudd in your eye!
Bart Simpson: (HEARTBROKEN) I can't believe I lost.
Lisa Simpson: That's not fair -- Bart was great.
Lisa Simpson: Hey Krusty, you're making a huge mistake not hiring my brother. Why don't you hire them both? It won't cost you anything -- you could call Bart an intern. (CONTINUED)
Lisa Simpson: In fact, the intern thing could open up a whole new world of free labor for you! Did you know the Discovery Channel doesn't have a single paid employee?
Krusty the Clown: Hm. Okay kid, you've convinced me!
Lisa Simpson: To make Bart a Krusketeer?
Krusty the Clown: Hell no! To make you my new intern. You're a real go-getter. Now go get me my dry-cleaning, which is my code word for scotch, and get me my scotch, which is my code word for my bookie. Also, go get my dry-cleaning.
Lisa Simpson: (STUNNED) Wha... but...
Krusty the Clown: (IMITATING HER) Wha, but, wha, wha, wha, but... What are you standing around for?! (EXITING, OVER SHOULDER) I wish I was paying you, so I could dock your salary!
(SOUNDSTAGE: ext. soundstage - day)
Sideshow Mel: Lisa didn't know it then, but she had just dipped her toe into the business of show. And it is a business, as you shall find out in about three seconds. Two... one...
(Krustylu Studios: EXT. Krustylu studios - day)
(Backstage: INT. backstage - "the KRUSTY show" - DAY)
Sideshow Mel: Over the years, show business has been home to scoundrels and saints, thespians and harlequins, Abbots and (RHYME WITH "EYE") Costelli. And they all had one thing in common -- an underpaid assistant.
Krusty the Clown: Cancel my one o'clock. Move my two o'clock to one o'clock and cancel that. Oh, and go to my joke file, and make all the "Sophia Lorens" into "Lindsay Lohans".
Lisa Simpson: So do a global change?
Krusty the Clown: What am I, Al Gore? Just do it!
Nelson Muntz: I'm just trying to hit my marks.
Krusty the Clown: (ANGRY) And I don't? Is that what you're saying?
Nelson Muntz: (NERVOUS) No, no! I think you're a consummate pro!
Krusty the Clown: Oh, so now you're judging me. Well, whaddaya think of this: you're fired!
Nelson Muntz: Yeah, well my mom says you're a selfish lover!
Krusty the Clown: I know what I want and I get it!
Krusty the Clown: I'll trash you in my memoirs!
Krusty the Clown: Pay attention! You'll be writing my memoirs!
Lisa Simpson: (TO SELF) I'll never last here.
Sideshow Mel: (CONSPIRATORIAL) Chin up, little gofer! You can succeed with Krusty. A few hints -- always carry a cigar in case he asks. Never meet his gaze. And if he mentions Mitzi Gaynor -- and he will -- for God's sake act like you know who she is...
Krusty the Clown: I got pastrami stuck in my teeth, and that's everybody's problem! Who's got floss?
Lisa Simpson: Here you go, Krusty.
Krusty the Clown: (SATISFIED GROAN, THEN:) Nicely done, kid. You're the best thing that's happened to this business since...
Lisa Simpson: Mitzi Gaynor?
Krusty the Clown: I was gonna say "cheap Korean animation," but sure.
(Simpson Home: Int. SIMPSON HOUSE - kitchen - dAY)
Bart Simpson: (FRUSTRATED GROAN) I can't believe you're working for Krusty and I'm not. I know everything about that clown. Favorite blintz -- blueberry. Favorite horse in the 2004 Belmont -- Smarty Jones. Krusty lost a bundle and had to endorse baby wipes in Norway. Which I have a case of!
Lisa Simpson: Krusty Klovnen Baby Visker?
Homer Simpson: Bart's having girl trouble. You better go talk to him.
Marge Simpson: It's clown trouble. That's your responsibility.
Homer Simpson: I thought I was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.
Marge Simpson: Yeah, well, we're adding clowns.
Homer Simpson: Fine -- but you just bought yourself "ear piercing" and "strange new feelings."
Marge Simpson: Fine.
Bart Simpson: Lisa's got school, career, posture -- why'd she have to steal Krusty from me?!
Bart Simpson: (READING FROM SCREEN) "The Inverted Double-struck Penny, or 'Kissing Lincolns'..."
Bart Simpson: I don't know why I agreed to this.
Homer Simpson: Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty...which appears to be everything. (GETS IDEA) Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room. (UPBEAT, BRAGGING) You know she works for Krusty now.

Comic Book Guy: My counter-offer: "Radioactive Man Meets the Kansas City Royals".
Bart Simpson: How 'bout "Radioactive Man versus Restless Leg Syndrome"?
Comic Book Guy: Let us try a different tack. Are you interested in coin collecting?
Bart Simpson: (INTERESTED) Am I?! (NOT INTERESTED) No.

Bart Simpson: All right, time to fill these slots with coins. (OPENS BOOK) Specific coins? (MOANS) This hobby sucks!

Bart Simpson: Wow, I never thought of it like that.

Ron Rabinowitz: Krusty, I've been your agent for forty-five years. I am telling you, watch out for this Lisa Simpson character. She has got a taste for Lady Laughter, and she will step right over a certain clown to get it.
Krusty the Clown: Which clown? Chuckles? Professor Nitwit?
Ron Rabinowitz: (SIGHS) No, you!
Krusty the Clown: No Yu, the Chinese Clown?
Ron Rabinowitz: (LAUGHS) Great one, Krusty. (SLIGHT CHUCKLE, THEN GRIM) But seriously, you're in real trouble here.
Krusty the Clown: (INTO PHONE) Yeah?... what do you mean? If there was a rehearsal for the network, I would've been told by my... (GASP OF REALIZATION) assistant?!

Krusty the Clown: (DESPERATE) La-la-la! I'm eight years old!

C. Montgomery Burns: Five hundred.
Homer Simpson: Five dollars (EYEING ALL) cash!

Homer Simpson: Five hundred and one!
C. Montgomery Burns: Ten million.

C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, but the problem is, if you had it, I wouldn't. You see the difficulty...

Lisa Simpson: (LOOKING AROUND, CONFUSED NOISE) I don't recognize any of them.
Sideshow Mel: And why should you?
Sideshow Mel: He appears nightly on Broadway... selling combs and mints in the men's room. She was fired after a bad rehearsal from "Homeboys In Outer Space".
Sideshow Mel: And perhaps the saddest one of all... He graced stages from London to Los Angeles. When he played Biff in "Death Of A Salesman," every woman in the audience wished they were Hap. (BEAT) But that was before he..."took the bone."
Lisa Simpson: (READING) Melvin van Horne... (GASPS) Sideshow Mel?! It's you! How could this happen to you... to all these wonderful performers?
Sideshow Mel: Applause is an addiction, like heroin or checking your email. Once you have a taste, you'll do anything to get more. Don't end up like these people. Don't end up like... (TURNS HEAD, EMOTIONAL) me.
Lisa Simpson: (HORRIFIED) I need to get out while I still can. (THEN) Thank you, Mel.
Lisa Simpson: Everyone, wait!
Lisa Simpson: Um, there's someone I forgot to thank, and he's here tonight. Krusty, will you come up on stage, please?
Krusty the Clown: What do you want? You've already taken everything I care about.
Lisa Simpson: (STAGY) Really? So what else is in the news?
Krusty the Clown: (ANGRY) This just in: I don't give a crap.
Lisa Simpson: (WHISPERS) I'm trying to set you up for laughs.
Krusty the Clown: You're trying to set me up with a giraffe?
Krusty the Clown: Oh, right. (CONFIDENTLY) You guys know about giraffes, long legs, big neck.

Krusty the Clown: Speakin' of necks, my girlfriend is a real pain in mine. She crashed her car into mine and said, "Look honey, we have a hybrid."
Audience: (LAUGHS)

Mayor Joe Quimby: Oh, come on people, your drunken shenanigans destroy this town every year. And Ireland is so much more than the imbibing of spirits. The Irish gave the world the paddy wagon, the shamrock shake, and folk dancing where you don't move your arms.

Lucky Jim: We'll put up your bail money. Just pay us ten per cent and show up for your court date.
Homer Simpson: (SLY) And if I don't show up?
Wolf: Then you gotta deal with me.
Wolf: (HARDBOILED) The name's Wolf and I'm a bounty hunter. If someone skips bail I track 'em down and bring 'em back. I also take a tooth, make a plaster cast, put it on this necklace (HOLDS UP NECKLACE OF TEETH) then replace the tooth at my expense.
Wolf: Well, time to go back to my world of sleazy bars, tattoo parlors, and greasy spoons.
Homer Simpson: What a great job. And I could use a job right now.
Wolf: Whoa, not just anyone can be a bounty hunter. You have to pass an online exam -- no wait, they got rid of that. There is a ten-dollar filing fee, but you can get around it. Congratulations, you're now a bounty hunter! (SHAKES HOMER'S HAND)

(Alley: int. alley - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Now, are you gonna come quietly, or do I have to...
Homer Simpson: (SCARED NOISE) Now, let's think about this. If you shoot me, I won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. But someone may come after you. Probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. What I'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life.

Snake Jailbird: (REMORSEFUL) She'd say that year off from Princeton was the worst decision I ever made.

Homer Simpson: ANGLE ON: GREETING CARD
Ned Flanders: What the?
Homer Simpson: It's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper.
Homer Simpson: Ned, I never thought I'd say this, but we make a great team.
Ned Flanders: Us... a team? As the salad said to the soup, "I'm all mixed up."
Homer Simpson: (SAD MOAN)
Homer Simpson: We should be bounty hunters together. You're kind and smart, I'm cruel and strong. Together, we're nothing. But together, we're the perfect bounty hunter.
Ned Flanders: Well... I could use money. But you have to promise me something, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Sure. What is it?
Ned Flanders: We have to do everything by the book.

Patrick: Oh, we have quite a selection.
Selma Bouvier: (INCREASINGLY EXCITED NOISES)
Patrick: I'll leave you with the book.
Marge Simpson: How could you not tell me this is an erotic bakery?!
Marge Simpson: Marge, calm down. For as long as there's been baking, there's been erotic baking. It fills a need, and harms no one.
Marge Simpson: Harms no one? (DERISIVE SNORT) Explain that to... (AT A LOSS) well what about... (AT A LOSS) I think you forgot about... (BEAT) Hmm...
Patrick: My number-one customers are married couples. Your friends and neighbors. I just made a custom order for the Hibberts.
Patrick: It's an exact replica of the good Doctor's... (OPENS BOX)
Patrick: (INTERRUPTING) I don't want to know!
Patrick: It's not what you think it is.
Patrick: Good.
Patrick: (CONVINCINGLY) Marge, this is a valuable public service. Without your baking, people like me will be forced into back alleys, repurposing Ho-Hos and Ding Dongs. You have a great gift. Don't let it go to waste!
Marge Simpson: Well... okay.

Marge Simpson: A sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
Homer Simpson: Yes, for now. (KISSES HER) I guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. Maybe we could order one of your cakes for Lisa's birthday.

Homer Simpson: Now let it unfurl in your stomach.
Ned Flanders: (NOISE OF PLEASURE)
Homer Simpson: (SEEING SOMETHING) There he is!

(SUBWAY PLATFORM: ext. subway platform - evening)
(Subway Car: int. subway car - continuous)
Ned Flanders: Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! You need a special sticker just to bring a bike! Have you no respect for the law?
Homer Simpson: (DISMISSIVE) Hey, it worked, didn't it? (TO FAT TONY) Okay smart guy, you're going in the bag.
Fat Tony: (GASPING NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Oh, wait. I left a sandwich in there.
Ned Flanders: Homer, no! You promised... Everything was supposed to be by the book!

Homer Simpson: I can't take another word out of you!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - evening - establishing)
Homer Simpson: I can't believe Flanders dumped me. Marge, do we have any more of your extra-long Twinkies?

Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Homie, I've got a confession to make: I'm an erotic baker.
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP)
Marge Simpson: I hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. But withholding sexy cake? I know we have to move past this, but I don't see how.

Lucky Jim: This is one jumper that Homer can't catch.
Ned Flanders: (GASPS) Homer!
Lucky Jim: Seems he never showed up in court on his St. Patrick's Day arrest.
Ned Flanders: Not interested.

(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - afternoon)
Homer Simpson: Hello! Hello? Anybody home? Hello?
Ned Flanders: You jumped bail, Homer. I gotta bring you in.
Homer Simpson: What have you done to my family?

Ned Flanders: (HEAVY SARCASM) Lucky guess.
Homer Simpson: Well, you'll never take me alive!
Homer Simpson: Forgot my keys.
(Springfield: ext. springfield - various places - afternoon)
Homer Simpson: I loved you, man!
Ned Flanders: For the last few weeks. But most of the time I've known you you've treated me like dirt!
Homer Simpson: You hang onto resentment like a Confederate widow.
Ned Flanders: I forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, but you hold onto the big things! The point is, the more I got to know you, the more I got to like you.
Ned Flanders: I like you too, but you broke the law. So I've got to bring you in.
Homer Simpson: So, it's gonna be like that, eh?
Homer Simpson: I've got you, my friend.
Ned Flanders: Thanks, but... what are you holding on to?
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm-- (SCREAMS)

Homer Simpson: Aw, dammit!
(CONCRETE: ext. - CONCRETE - NIGHT)
Ned Flanders: "...lest I come and strike the earth with a curse." Thus ends the book of Malachi. I guess I did know the whole Old Testament by heart. Out with the old... in with the new. Testament, that is. Matthew One. "The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham..."

Bart Simpson: (DEJECTED NOISE) I wish I had a cell phone.
Lisa Simpson: (TRYING TO HELP) Here's an imaginary cell phone.
Bart Simpson: What, do you think I'm crazy?
Bart Simpson: Mom, even Milhouse has a cell phone! Your son is lamer than Milhouse! What does that say about you?!

Dr. Julius Hibbert: Here you go.
Bart Simpson: (ANGRY) Don't tell me where I go. (THEN) A dollar? What for?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: It's the least I can do -- these balls cost five dollars new.
Bart Simpson: So I can get a dollar for every ball I find?! (PONDERING) Then if a cell phone costs one hundred dollars, how many balls do I need?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: This is why my kids go to private school. (CHUCKLES)

Krusty the Clown: Come on, Ice Age -- take the shot!
Denis Leary: (TO KRUSTY, ANNOYED) "Ice Age" was the name of the film -- I played Diego, the vicious saber-toothed tiger, who, guess what, has a heart. Now shut up. Or I'll have you all kicked out of show business.

(Van Houten Home: int. milhouse's house - living room - continuous)
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, I know you don't have a cell phone, so you must be in your kitchen or one of your bedrooms. Unless you have a wall jack in your basement -- that would be huge.
Bart Simpson: Look outside your window.
Milhouse Van Houten: I'm not supposed to look out the window when I'm alone.
Bart Simpson: Just do it!
Milhouse Van Houten: (EXCITED) Cell phone!
Milhouse Van Houten: Let's assign each other ringtones!
Bart Simpson: That felt good.

Bart Simpson: Sure -- on one condition. I wanna do my own poops.
Brian Grazer: I wouldn't have it any other way.
Bart Simpson: Of course I'll do it for minimum. Great. I'll see you next Monday in Tunisia.
Bart Simpson: (ANSWERS) Yo. Who's this?
Milhouse Van Houten: Dennis Leary? Boston comedian turned movie star turned basic cable notable?
Bart Simpson: That's right! (EXCITED) Let's call his business manager and tell him to spend all his money on Yankees hats and Derek Jeter jerseys.
Milhouse Van Houten: I don't know, Bart. What if Denis Leary gets mad?
Bart Simpson: Naw, he's cool. He's gonna think this is hilarious.

Bart Simpson: Which one, the one that got canceled or the one that's gonna get canceled?
Denis Leary: You are so dead!
Milhouse Van Houten: (LAUGH)
Marge Simpson: That laughter sounds like the result of misbehavior. (NOTICING) Bart! How did you get a cell phone?
Bart Simpson: Same way you got me: by accident, on a golf course.

Denis Leary: Damn straight you can! I'm Denis Leary, and your kid is out of control!
Marge Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) I'm sorry, Mr. Leary. Sometimes it's hard to be a parent.
Denis Leary: No it's not, it's easy! I'll tell you what's hard -- having to watch my stunt double run into a burning building! Worrying that people might realize it's not me, it's him. Try doing that!
Marge Simpson: (SAD) I don't think I could. (SIGHS) Mr. Leary, I'm so sorry. I'll send you your phone back right away.
Denis Leary: Keep the phone. In fact, can I give you some advice?
Marge Simpson: Of course, you're Denis Leary!
Denis Leary: Give your kid back the phone... but first, activate its built-in G.P.S. system. That way you can log on to your carrier's website, and track your son's movements, the way I track every actor who gets a movie that I was up for. (PEEKS OUTSIDE THROUGH WINDOW BLINDS)
Marge Simpson: Shouldn't you just be happy for their success?

Warrior Statue: They forced their children to live in this walled mountain city.

Marge Simpson: Alberto, I'm not sure if this is such a good idea.

Homer Simpson: (TIPSY) I came here once with Marge. Are you Marge, Sylvia?
Sylvia: (SWEETLY) Homer, I can be whoever you want me to be.
Homer Simpson: (SMALL AND SAD) I want you to be Marge.
Homer Simpson: Marge?!

Alberto: Why do married women always have husbands?
Homer Simpson: Marge, what are you doing here?
Marge Simpson: Uh... the same thing you're doing here.
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) You better not be! (CATCHING HIMSELF) I mean, great! We both came to rekindle our precious memories of when we were young and in love. Right?
Marge Simpson: We sure did. (LOOKS AROUND ROOM, AS IF CHECKING THINGS OFF) Rekindle, rekindle... Okay, let's go.
Homer Simpson: Oh, oh, oh, I have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here.

Homer Simpson: (HAUGHTY) Ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare.
Ruthie: (SHRUGS) Okay.
Homer Simpson: (CALLING BACK, DOPPLER) I wish I'd never met you!

Lisa Simpson: Just ask those guys for directions.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (PUZZLED) Hmm... Anti-nuclear activist Dr. Helen Caldicott... director Julie Taymor... do you love these women?
Jimbo Jones: They're okay, I guess.
DOLPH: Let's just skip to the Windsor knot instructions.

Homer Simpson: Forever? That would be awesome.
Ned Flanders: Okay, here she comes! Why don't you take Marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?
Homer Simpson: (WARY) And I suppose you and Maude will be coming along as well?
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Don't you think I've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?

Marge Simpson: You make me feel that way too.
Homer Simpson: I know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, I'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it.

Homer Simpson: Awww.

Homer Simpson: Now we wait for the river to freeze. If my theory of global cooling is correct.
Bart Simpson: Hey, you guys want a lift in my pedal boat?
Homer Simpson: (EXULTANT) She blew it again! Woo-hoo!
Lisa Simpson: (SARCASTIC) It's not a pedal boat. It's a pedal car that Bart drove into the river. Because he knows a shortcut that's not on the map.
Bart Simpson: How'd you like a shortcut to the bottom of the river?
Lisa Simpson: (DRYLY) If it's your shortcut, I'll be high and dry.
Bart Simpson: Knock it off back there.

Seymour Skinner: (ENCOURAGED) Gee. Compared to you, my life is one big half-day!
Homer Simpson: (ENCOURAGING) Exactly. You're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?
Seymour Skinner: Thanks, Homer. I don't think the school pep squad could've cheered me up more. And they were state runners up in nineteen ninety-seven!
Carl Carlson: Homer, that was amazing -- he actually felt better comin' outta the break-up than he did goin' in.

Carl Carlson: She may never take back your name, but there's still a chance she'll take you back as a Daddy.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.
Moe Szyslak: So the name "Lisa Simpson" is available, huh? (CONSIDERING) Lotta goodwill attached to that name... (NODS) I'm gonna take it.

Marge Simpson: Lisa, sweetie, I'm honored that you choose my name, but it's not that great. Back in high school, the boys used to call me Marge "BOOB"-ier.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, Bouvier was Jackie Kennedy's maiden name.
Marge Simpson: (SURPRISED) Really? I never knew that.
Lisa Simpson: Well what did you think her name was before it was Kennedy?
Marge Simpson: Jackie "O." Like Spaghetti-o's. I thought that was where her money came from. Look, why don't you cheer up by doing a New York Times crossword puzzle, huh?
Lisa Simpson: I'm through with crosswords! My innocence died in those four hundred and forty-one little boxes.
Marge Simpson: It might be a fun way to kill a couple hours.

Lisa Simpson: "Last clue: "Loses on purpose". Hmmm... (GASPS, THEN WRITES) "DIETS!" (GIGGLES) Oh, Will Shortz, you clever rascal.
Lisa Simpson: And a new record time! (LOOKS AT PUZZLE) Wait a second...
Lisa Simpson: (READING) "DUMB DAD SORRY FOR HIS BET." Wow, it's almost as if Dad planted that message. No, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? Oh, it must be...or mustn't it not?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the New York Times crossword puzzle?
Homer Simpson: Well, I had a little help from this guy.
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) New York Times Crossword Editor Will Shortz!
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) And master puzzle constructor Merl Reagle?!
Merl Reagle: I actually wrote that crossword.
Will Shortz: (A LITTLE PEEVISH) And I edited it. Now get back to cross-wording!
Merl Reagle: (CHASTENED) Yes sir.
Lisa Simpson: (NOT QUITE WON OVER) Well I must admit, I'm kind of touched. (SHY GIGGLE) "DUMB DAD SORRY FOR HIS BET." Nice.
Will Shortz: You didn't get Homer's whole message, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: I didn't?!
Will Shortz: Take a look at the first letters of all the clues.
Homer Simpson: Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you.

Lisa Simpson: It's not for long. But until they find a suitable habitat, this beard is the only hope for these bees.
Bart Simpson: Relax, Mom. I'll mold them into a shape you know and love.
Marge Simpson: Stop Milhousing your sister!
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: Now take it off before they sting you!
Lisa Simpson: Actually, bees rarely sting when they're in a cluster. They only attack to defend their hive.
Marge Simpson: (UNSURE NOISE) I don't know. All it takes is one troubled loner.
Lisa Simpson: Please let me keep them for just a little longer.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Okay. One night.

Mark Cuban: Oh, yeah! Three points! Big three in the big D for the big C. Mark Cuban -- that's me!
C. Montgomery Burns: Who is that man, and why isn't his enthusiasm being punished?
Waylon Smithers: That's Mark Cuban, sir. He's the most flamboyant owner in the league.
Mark Cuban: I'm out of my mind!!!
C. Montgomery Burns: How odd. His money seems to have bought him happiness.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'd like to meet him, Smithers!
(Burns's Box: Int. Burns' Box - a little Later)
Mark Cuban: So, you made your money in Nuclear Power. I can't remember how I made my money!
C. Montgomery Burns: I see.
C. Montgomery Burns: If you're really a billionaire, give me the secret billionaire's handshake. Smithers, turn away.
C. Montgomery Burns: (HAPPY NOISE)
C. Montgomery Burns: So tell me, why don't you recoil from the public like a normal billionaire?
Mark Cuban: Hey, why own a basketball team if you're not gonna have any fun?
C. Montgomery Burns: "Fun?" Is that how it's pronounced? I've only seen it written.
Mark Cuban: Hold that thought... no one's paid attention to me for ten whole seconds.
C. Montgomery Burns: (POINTS TO SELF) It's time for this peacock to show his feathers. You know, the feathers with the big eye that trick them into thinking that's my front? Said feathers are what I'll flaunt!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room - morning)
Bart Simpson: Um Mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes.
Homer Simpson: The secret is not to swallow the stingers.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, don't eat the bees!
Homer Simpson: (ROLLS EYES) They're just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart.
Bart Simpson: Yeah!
Marge Simpson: Listen Lisa, I was trying to think of a way to help your bees and I remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town.
Homer Simpson: Which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til I was hired to run it. (CHUCKLES)
(Field: ext. field - day)
Marge Simpson: Your bees will have plenty of room in this old greenhouse. Plus there are flowers, and it's near a prison so they'll have a place to sting people.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Mom, it's perfect!
Lisa Simpson: Go, live your lives, get off my face!
Lisa Simpson: (SNIFFS A LITTLE) Oh, I miss them.
Marge Simpson: Now you know how I'll feel when you go to college.

Lisa Simpson: There's only one place in town where the bees can survive. And Mr. Burns wants to tear it down. Please, people. You didn't listen to me about the snail darter, you didn't listen to me about the osprey, and you didn't listen to me about the javelina.
Lenny Leonard: The feisty pig of the desert?
Lisa Simpson: Apparently not feisty enough. Future generations will judge us by how we cared for the tiniest creatures. I am not just asking you to save the bees. I am asking you to save your souls.
C. Montgomery Burns: (FEIGNING SINCERITY) Excellent speech. Just excellent. I no longer wish to build my magnificent new basketball stadium.
Lisa Simpson: You don't?
C. Montgomery Burns: Heavens no!
C. Montgomery Burns: No skyboxes... no "kiss cam"...
C. Montgomery Burns: Nor will we have the chance to marvel at number one draft pick Muk Mu, the human North Pole.

Moe Szyslak: Are you sure?
Lisa Simpson: (TIPSY) Give me the keys!
Moe Szyslak: Okay, okay! (HANDS HER THE KEYS) Don't know why I had 'em in the first place.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) I'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
Moe Szyslak: Really?
Moe Szyslak: Listen Homer, in the back room I got these super-tough Africanized bees. I saw this ad in a gentleman's magazine for excited African honeys, and that's what they sent me. If we could combine them with Lisa's bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment.
Homer Simpson: Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?
Moe Szyslak: (GETS IDEA) Actually Homer...
Homer Simpson: (EYES WIDE, GASPS) You and me?
Moe Szyslak: No, the bees!
Homer Simpson: (PROTESTING TOO MUCH) Oh yeah, yeah, that's what I meant too. I have no... inclination...
Moe Szyslak: Got the queen?

Lisa Simpson: My bees?
Jeff Bezos: He's not a billionaire at all!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Your bees died days ago. These are their angry, mutant descendants. And they're tough enough to live in any environment.
Lisa Simpson: They sound awfully mad. Are they dangerous?
Homer Simpson: Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check.
Homer Simpson: Are you guys dangerous?
Homer Simpson: (HAUGHTY) A simple "yes" would've sufficed.

The Rich Texan: He's only worth nine hundred ninety six million, thirty-six thousand dollars.
C. Montgomery Burns: (BURNS) Wait, wait, wait, it's only a matter of four million. I'm sure I can find that somewhere. (PULLS OUT WALLET AND COUNTS MONEY) I, uh, I have fifty dollars here in my wallet...

Juliet Hobbes: Maybe not, but it's better than this.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah.
Lisa Simpson: So the armies of the gnomes and the elves faced off on either side of the hollow, broad axes poised.
Juliet Hobbes: With a fearsome cry they raced toward the center of the battlefield, banners aflutter in the breeze.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (IMPATIENT) What comes next?!
Lisa Simpson: A battle to determine the fate of Equalia. But you wouldn't be interested.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: I have a wide variety of interests. Is there them dragon things?
Lisa Simpson: Isn't that a little clichéd?
Lisa Simpson: Yes! I mean, yes -- there are dragons everywhere! Green ones, Chinese ones, (SLY) chubby bald ones...
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (QUICKLY) I like those ones! Tell me about those!

Bart Simpson: (LAUGHS, THEN TAUNTING) Re-jected!
Marge Simpson: You got a letter all the way from New York City, and that's something!
Homer Simpson: And you know what else, sweetie? You and your friend Princess Nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad.
Homer Simpson: Okay, chapter one... uh... uh... (MOANS) writing is hard.

Bart Simpson: Homer, that guy's your age?
Homer Simpson: (POUTY) No, he's ten days younger.
Lisa Simpson: So you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?
Homer Simpson: If he's lucky.
Homer Simpson: The guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's God. Well, God doesn't need his own special day!
Bart Simpson: What about Sunday?
Homer Simpson: Sunday's the Lord's day, boy. Not God's. Completely different guy.
Marge Simpson: Your father's just jealous because Vance was our class president in high school.
Homer Simpson: (SURLY) If I had won Class President, I'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, you ran for Class President?
Homer Simpson: Yup -- back in high school, right before I met your mother. A simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation...

Bart Simpson: He looks happy.
Homer Simpson: (KNOW-IT-ALL) Tears of a clown.
Lisa Simpson: He's not crying and he's not known for clowning.
Homer Simpson: (KNOW-IT-ALL) Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. Watch, I'll prove it.
Homer Simpson: Angry nut coming through.
Chief Wiggum: Clear a path, boys.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Vance?
Vance Connor: (FRIENDLY) Hey, Homer Simpson! How you been?

Carl Carlson: Yeah, me too.
Homer Simpson: Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life.
Homer Simpson: Why did you just exchange that look of guilt?

Carl Carlson: (SIGHS) Lenny, uh, I think it's time for us to come clean.
Lenny Leonard: About how we give each other haircuts?

Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED) Hey!
Homer Simpson: Marge, I still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter.
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: Dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better.
Homer Simpson: That's exactly what it means. And Dondelinger took that life away from me. And the taking of a life is murder. And the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but I'm gonna find Dondelinger and tell him I know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!

Homer Simpson: Dondelinger! I should have been Class President, but you stole the election from me.
Principal Dondelinger: I can explain. But... are you sure we should talk in front of your son?
Homer Simpson: Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame.
Bart Simpson: (PLEASANT) I already knew that, Dad. I'm gonna blame you.
Homer Simpson: I respect your choice. Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.
Bart Simpson: With a virgin Tom Collins for me?
Homer Simpson: (SNORTS) Virgin? What are you, a girl?
Homer Simpson: Now, Dondelinger, I want some answers.
Principal Dondelinger: Very well. It's a fact I didn't like you, Simpson. Still don't.
Homer Simpson: You lie. You love me!
Principal Dondelinger: Whatever complex emotions I feel, they're not why I did what I did. There was another reason...
Jock #1: Homer Simpson. What a loser.
Jock #2: (GETTING IDEA) Hey, what if we got everyone to vote for him, as a joke, and he won?
Jock #1: Then we could laugh at him all the way through high school and at every reunion.
Jock #2: Gooooo sports!
Principal Dondelinger: So you see, I disposed of the ballot box to spare your feelings.
Principal Dondelinger: Mm-hm... As Principal, I did a lot of things I'm not proud of.
Principal Dondelinger: I would steal school chalk for my home chalkboard.
Principal Dondelinger: But I'm not sorry I rigged that election. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to sit under that tree and think of all the women I could've talked to but didn't.

Luigi: Oh, you could know. If you dared.
Homer Simpson: Huh? Who said that?
Luigi: In the kitchen is a man from the old country who works for me. He stirs the sauce-a.
Luigi: (MYSTERIOUS) They say if he stirs the sauce-a just-a right, he can also see what might have-a been.

Nelson Muntz: (STUNNED) No pizza party?
Otto Mann: (SHOCKED) Not a helicopter?! Huh?
Otto Mann: (HUMS "RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES")

Bart Simpson: Told ya.

Marge Simpson: You mean back to the poor house?
Homer Simpson: Fine. Back. And we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
Marge Simpson: I don't want anyone to ever get hurt.
Homer Simpson: Me too, baby. But we gotta get real.

Bart Simpson: What about my birthday party?
Homer Simpson: This counts as that.
Homer Simpson: Ladies, how're you doing with the float?
Lisa Simpson: Fine, but I wish you'd picked an easier theme than "Super-Jet Dinosaur Fun-Monkeys." What does that even mean?
Marge Simpson: Homie... every year this party gets a little bigger. I'm afraid it's growing out of hand.
Carl Carlson: Hey Homer, I have some distant relatives that I never see except for this party. Can I bring 'em to the party?

Marge Simpson: You know, it says here that Grampa has to remain in the house, but we don't. How about a family outing?
Bart Simpson: Family outing? I'll start -- Lisa's gay!
Lisa Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Right, 'cause I wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes Billie Jean King, Susan Sontag, Sappho of Lesbos, and, I suspect, Peppermint Patty...
Homer Simpson: Well, I guess we can take a quick walk. We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf.
Dwight Eisenhower: Now when I've got a downhill lie, I like to swing wide -- just like Patton did when he swung past Kesselring's boys in the Ardennes forest. Let's watch.

Nat Gladness: (CHUCKLES) Well now, I'll just put my John Hancock on the doc, and you can give me the key to the lock!
Ned Flanders: (OFFERING PEN) My ballpoint is all clicked-up for you.
Nat Gladness: Oh, no, thanks. Don't believe in borrowing things from my neighbor.
Ned Flanders: Lord, you said love thy neighbor, but you didn't have to make it so easy.
Nancy Gladness: Whatcha got there, Woofy Goldberg?
Nancy Gladness: Who's this?
Ned Flanders: (FEELING GUILTY) Oh, that's just a family... who used to... make my life, uh... (CHOKED UP) interesting.
Nat Gladness: I'll just add my initials, there...
Photo Simpsons: "FOR HE'S A FABULOUS FLANDERS..."
Nat Gladness: (INITIALING) There...
Photo Simpsons: "WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY!"
Nat Gladness: (INITIALING) Ooh, and there. Exciting!
Ned Flanders: (SOBS) Folks...
Nat Gladness: Aaaand... leased.
Ned Flanders: I'm afraid you can't live here.
Nat Gladness: Roger dodger. Back in the car, Nance.
Nancy Gladness: Yay! But why?
Ned Flanders: Well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. But I love 'em. And, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. Hope you don't mind.
Nat Gladness: And I hope you won't mind when we sue.
Ned Flanders: I think you should. The court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
Nat Gladness: (HAPPILY) Well, hasn't this been a peach of a breach! (LAUGHS) We'll see you in court.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Flanders, I promise I'll never abuse our friendship again.
Ned Flanders: It's okay if you backslide a little.
Homer Simpson: Never! Hooray for Stupid Flanders!
Ned Flanders: The Simpsons are back!
(Evergreen Terrace: Ext. evergreen terrace - another angle)
Homer Simpson: I really hate this neighborhood.
Homer Simpson: (CALLING AFTER HER) Yeah, right! And I'm married to Wonder Woman!
Narrator: (SLIGHTLY OMINOUS) For centuries, man has been ruled by science and industry. But that era is drawing to a close.
Narrator: We stand on the cusp of a new epoch: one of prophecy, puzzles and signs in the sky.
Narrator: And that epoch begins today!
Kent Brockman: Our top story: today, Springfield will experience a rare total eclipse of the sun.
Kent Brockman: A solar eclipse is like a woman breast-feeding at a restaurant: it's free, it's beautiful, but under no circumstances should you look at it. We recommend using a homemade "camera obscura," fashioned from an ordinary shoebox and paper-towel tube...
Kent Brockman: This was supposed to be pre-made! Fine, I'll do it myself!
Kent Brockman: Where's the end of the frickin' tape?! (STANDS) Forget it -- we'll do it next week.
Stagehand: (OFF MIC) The eclipse is today!

Bart Simpson: Hit the road, ya big load!
Homer Simpson: (SADLY) My space toy!
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) It's okay, Homie -- you can have my viewer. (HANDS IT TO HIM)
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, you'll miss the eclipse.
Marge Simpson: There'll be another one in North Yemen in 2027.
Lisa Simpson: We have totality, people!
Lisa Simpson: (IMPRESSED NOISES)
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED) We'll be talking about this together for years!
Lisa Simpson: For years... for years...

Dr. Julius Hibbert: Now Simpsons, I must warn you -- any stress could increase the blood pressure in Marge's eyeballs, leading to what we call "Tex Avery Syndrome."
Homer Simpson: (UPSET) Wolves are taking all our women.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day - establishing)
Marge Simpson: You guys have treated me like a princess. Every day's been like the first ten minutes of Mother's Day!
Homer Simpson: You just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
Lisa Simpson: (SOTTO TO HOMER) Dad! Come in the kitchen! Quick!
Homer Simpson: Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
(KITCHEN: Int. kitchen - moments later)
Homer Simpson: Aw, rats in the kitchen. Just like that delightful movie I taped in the theater.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLE) Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy.
Homer Simpson: Hmmm, this is good.

Homer Simpson: Oh, we're too heavy.
Homer Simpson: Let's see: I need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but I can only take one thing at a time. I can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and I can't leave the dog alone with the baby.
Homer Simpson: Can't someone help me with this puzzle?
Homer Simpson: Professor Frink! Help me figure this out!
Homer Simpson: Yo! Over here!
Professor Jonathan Frink: Wha-- (FRINK SWALLOWING PELLET NOISE, THEN CONVULSING BRIEFLY)
Homer Simpson: Great time to nap, Einstein!
(River Bank: EXT. RIVER BANK - EVENINg - ten minutes later)
Homer Simpson: Okay, Maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved, so listen up. (QUICKLY) First I row Maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison. Then I row back alone, take the poison over and bring Maggie back. Then I take the dog over, come back, get Maggie, row across, and before I know it, I'm back at home!
Homer Simpson: (MAD) Were you listening at all?
(River: Ext. River - evening (momENTS LATER))
Cletus Spuckler: Sir, I'd be obliged to you if you'd help me puzzle out my fox, duck and corn situation.

(Springfield: EXT. SPRINGFIELD - SHORE - EVENING)

Homer Simpson: (SING-SONG) I see you! I see you!
Homer Simpson: I see-- (CONFUSED NOISE)
Mother Superior: Look at that -- one of God's discarded miracles.
Homer Simpson: (QUICK SCREAM) Catholics!
(CONVENT: Ext. Convent - evening (MOMENTS LATER))
Homer Simpson: Give me my baby back!
Mother Superior: (IRISH) Sir, our mission is quite clear.
Mother Superior: (BRUSQUELY) Any child left here will be cared for by the Sisters of St. Teresa. Why would you leave such a beautiful baby on our doorstep?
Homer Simpson: 'Cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. Now give her back so I can take her home to my rat-infested house!
Mother Superior: No. The poor dear is right where she belongs. God help you, sir! (SHE SLIDES THE WINDOW CLOSED)
Homer Simpson: Come on, lady, have a heart. I screwed up! I'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!
Mother Superior: (OPENS WINDOW) I'm married to Jesus!
Homer Simpson: Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie.
Bart Simpson: But Dr. Hibbert said not to stress her out.
Lisa Simpson: Wait, I have an idea! One of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent.
Homer Simpson: ("SITCOM") Oh no, oh no, ohhh no. There is no way Homer Simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun.
(CONVENT STEPS: EXT. CONVENT STEPS - the next morning)
Homer Simpson: (STANDING NEXT TO HER) Told you there was no way I would do it.
Homer Simpson: (BEAT) Are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'Cause I can do it. I got the outfit right here.
Homer Simpson: (SELLING, UPBEAT) Huh?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, leave -- so I can get into character.
Lisa Simpson: Hello. I'm a poor little sinner who's lost her way. May I join your order?
Mother Superior: How do you feel about kneeling?
Lisa Simpson: Can't get enough.
Mother Superior: You're in.
(CONVENT: INT. CONVENT - day)
Mother Superior: Finally, you must wear your habit modestly at all times -- not like Sister Marilyn.
Nun: (SINGS) IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT / THAT'S A SIN...
Nun: (SINGS) IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT / THAT'S A SIN...
Lisa Simpson: (TO HERSELF) Where's Maggie?
Lisa Simpson: (CAGEY) Mother Superior, are those all the babies in our orphanage?
Mother Superior: (SNAPPING) Lookin' for more unwanted babies, are ya? Well, next week's nine months after the prom. They'll be stacked up to the ceiling.
Lisa Simpson: No, I was just thinking you might have some in the back you haven't put out yet.
Mother Superior: Oh, a Doubting Thomas, are ya?
Lisa Simpson: Well, more of a curious George.
Mother Superior: Well, little monkey, it's time for you to spend some time with the man in the yellow hat.
Lisa Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) Why would Mother Superior lie to me about not having Maggie? (LOOKS UP AS IF TO HEAVEN) What is going on?
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) A jewel! (PUZZLED) Why would nuns want a jewel?
Mysterious Nun: (ITALIAN GRANDMOTHER VOICE) Find the jewel, find what you desire.
Lisa Simpson: The jewel will lead me to my baby sister? Why are you telling me this?
Marge Simpson: Goodnight, Bart.
Mysterious Nun: Because I'm sick of that Mother Superior. Whenever we play football, she has to be quarterback.
Mysterious Nun: Now, you must solve a series of clues.
Lisa Simpson: (EXCITED GASP) You mean an increasingly difficult series of challenges to my intellect? That's so cool.
Mysterious Nun: Plus, you find your sister.
Lisa Simpson: (PERFUNCTORY) Oh sure.
Mysterious Nun: Your first clue.
Mysterious Nun: (WAGGING FINGER) And before you decide to become a nun, consider this: I am only twenty-three! (EVIL LAUGH)
Lisa Simpson: Hm...
Lisa Simpson: "Quaerite Deum in corde et anima." That's Latin... "Deum" is God... and of course "Quaerite" means "seek"... "Seek God with heart and soul."
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS, GETTING IT) "Heart and Soul"...
Lisa Simpson: (SINGING) I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU / HEART AND SOUL...
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - evening - establishing)
Marge Simpson: Homie, I haven't held Maggie all day. Can you hand her to me?
Homer Simpson: Um... No problem, sweetie.
Marge Simpson: Ooo, mommy's little baby is getting big and chubby! (PINCHES THE ARM) Who's a chubby baby?
Marge Simpson: But that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner.
Marge Simpson: Hm. You're not usually this greedy.
Homer Simpson: Cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
HOMER'S HAND: (SEÑOR WENCES VOICE) You cool it -- I'm hungry!
(Chapel: INT. chapel - organ loft - EVENING)
Lisa Simpson: A cryptic message! Maybe this will lead me to the gem!
Lisa Simpson: Hmm, what if I read every other word? (READS, GETTING INCREASINGLY INSULTED) "One more time, you're hopeless. Try again, numb skull." (OFFENDED) That's not very nice -- I will try again, but not because the wall told me to. (READS) "Turn around. Seek Springfield's biggest man-made ring." (GASPS)
Lisa Simpson: Big ring... big ring...
Lisa Simpson: So many rings! But which one is the key to finding the gem?
Lisa Simpson: Well? Did you get it?
Milhouse Van Houten: No. (EMBARRASSED) I'm not a smart nerd, I'm just a weak nerd.
Lisa Simpson: The biggest ring in Springfield...comes from the bell in the Springfield Bell Tower!
Lisa Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: (PLEASED NOISE)
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - evENING (establishing))
Marge Simpson: (CALLING OUT) I'll be right in, Lisa!

(Clock Tower: INT. CLOCK TOWER - BELFRY - NIGHT)
Lisa Simpson: Ha! Principal Skinner? Comic Book Guy? What are you doing here?
Comic Book Guy: Following you. We seek the gem of Saint Teresa.
Lisa Simpson: Oh. Well, I seek it so I can find my sister. (THEN, PUZZLED) How do you know about the gem?
Comic Book Guy: We are an ancient order of mystery buffs, who hide in shadow, and call ourselves... (DRAMATIC) "The Brethren of the Quest."
Seymour Skinner: (UPBEAT) Because we do our sleuthing in Mother's Nissan Quest Minivan.
Lisa Simpson: Tell me all you know about the gem.
Seymour Skinner: Never!
Lisa Simpson: (SLY) Does your mother know you're using her minivan?
Seymour Skinner: (INSTANTLY) You see, legend has it that on her deathbed, Saint Teresa of Avila had a vision of a jewel that would usher in an era of peace and harmony...
(CONVENT: Int. Convent - spain - evening (1582))
Seymour Skinner: She dispatched a team of nuns to the New World to seek this fabulous gem...
(SAILING SHIP: ext. sailing ship - atlantic ocean - day (1582))
Seymour Skinner: They landed at what is now Philadelphia...and used the timbers of their ship to construct a convent.
(FIELD NEAR BEACH: ext. field near BEACH - day)
Seymour Skinner: The order flourished, never forgetting its sacred mission. But word about the gem got out...and a group of high-ranking Freemasons, led by Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and King George the Third, staged a phony war of "independence" to cover their search for the gem.
Seymour Skinner: Fleeing the violence, the nuns of Saint Teresa's left the colonies and settled here in Springfield.
(BELL TOWER: Ext. Bell tower - night - end flashback)
Comic Book Guy: Legend, and Wikipedia, have it that the gem will be revealed during the first full moon after a solar eclipse.
Lisa Simpson: (LOOKS AT FULL MOON) That's tonight!
Comic Book Guy: (DUH) Adoy. One question remains: why did you come here?
Lisa Simpson: (SMUGLY) Because I cleverly deduced the answer to Springfield's biggest ring. (INDICATING BELL) Voila!
Comic Book Guy: Well, it gives me no pleasure to say... (ENJOYING IT) your deduction was faulty.
Comic Book Guy: This is a fake papier-mâché bell. The real bell was melted down in World War Two to make civil war chess sets. Four of which I own.
Lisa Simpson: Oh my God. I know what the biggest "ring" in "Springfield" is. It's been right in front of us the whole time.
Comic Book Guy: Ah, yes, I see it!
Seymour Skinner: (LYING) I see it too. Let's, uh, head that way. We'll walk, or drive, to... the obvious solution.
(Hillside Near Springfield Sign: EXT. HILLSIDE near SPRINGFIELD SIGN - NIGHT)
Seymour Skinner: Oh, the word "ring!"
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, well. If it isn't the Tardy Boys and Nancy Clueless.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Burns! What are you doing here?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, I've known about the gem for years. You see, my dear girl, I joined the Freemasons before it was trendy. That's my eyeball on the dollar bill.
C. Montgomery Burns: That's also my pyramid.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hence I trailed you on your quest, accompanied by my faithful albino.
Waylon Smithers: I keep telling you, I'm not an albino. I just use a lot of sun-block.
C. Montgomery Burns: Then why do I give you all the albino holidays off? Hm? Hm?
Lisa Simpson: Look -- there's writing on the "R!"
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, everything is "writing" to you young people!
Lisa Simpson: From this angle they're words!
Lisa Simpson: (READING) "Great"...
Lisa Simpson: "Crimes"... (RUNS TO "N") "Kill" "Holy"... (RUNS TO "G") "Sage"...
Seymour Skinner: "Great crimes kill holy sage?" The puzzle is solved! We must warn the holy sage at once!
Lisa Simpson: No, that's not it! A secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram.
C. Montgomery Burns: Fine. Then you (POINTING TO LISA) unscramble those letters to spell out the location of the gem... (MENACING, TO SKINNER AND COMIC BOOK GUY) while you two dig your own graves.
Comic Book Guy: Superman, I have believed in you for years. If you can hear me now, please come help me dig this giant grave.
(Hillside Near Springfield Sign: EXT. HILLSIDE BY SPRINGFIELD SIGN - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: So, the anagram spells: "Regally, the rock gem is..."
Lisa Simpson: (PUZZLED) "...Lisa?"
C. Montgomery Burns: (SINISTER) So the gem is inside you?
Waylon Smithers: Sir, stop! She is the gem!
C. Montgomery Burns: (GASPS) Of course. St. Teresa wouldn't be interested in a mere bauble. Her greatest treasure would be a pure young girl. You are pure, aren't you?
Lisa Simpson: Does kissing Milhouse count?
Comic Book Guy: No.
Lisa Simpson: It all adds up. I am the gem that will bring world peace! How brilliant of God to remove my skepticism by making me his chosen one!
Comic Book Guy: According to legend, the gem must be brought to the convent by sunrise.
Seymour Skinner: We could make it if we took Mr. Burns's helicopter.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmm... I don't really want you people inside, but you could dangle from the skids.
Seymour Skinner: Deal.
(CONVENT: Ext. convent - just before sunrise)
Waylon Smithers: Feels good to help someone, doesn't it, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: No. It feels weird.
Lisa Simpson: (COCKY) Look who's here!
Lisa Simpson: Oh, fine, fine, finish your song. I can be patient -- after all, I am the gem child.
Mother Superior: Hush, you foolish girl! The gem is over there!
Lisa Simpson: Maggie?
Lisa Simpson: No, no, no -- the solution was "Regally the rock gem is Lisa".
Mother Superior: (ROLLS EYES) Oh, please. How many sentences start with the word "Regally"?
Lisa Simpson: Um... this one?
Mother Superior: Oh, give me that!
Lisa Simpson: (READING CRESTFALLEN) It's really Maggie, Sherlock. You know, I have to point out that this anagram only works if I get the wrong answer first.
Mother Superior: I said hush!
Mother Superior: Now begins a new era of peace and prosperity for Springfield.
Nelson Muntz: (SWEETLY) Aw, aw.
Manager: C'mon man, that's the fifth call you missed today!
Umpire: That's it! You're outta--
Warden: (TO GUARD) Just set it to "massage."
Snake Jailbird: (PLEASED NOISE) Something tells me the Gem of St. Teresa's been returned to its throne.
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) Maggie -- it's true! You are the Gem Child!
Mother Superior: (SMILES) Four centuries of patient sacrifice has finally paid off. All is peace and harmony.
Marge Simpson: Give me my baby back!
Lisa Simpson: Mom! How did you know Maggie was here?
Marge Simpson: A mother knows!
Marge Simpson: (ADORING) Maggie, you're coming home with me!
Lisa Simpson: Mom, wait! Maggie is the gem child! She's brought peace to our town! And reports of less road rage in Shelbyville! She has to stay here!
Marge Simpson: Well, it would be nice if the first thing I saw was a world at peace...
Marge Simpson: You're even more beautiful than I remembered.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry. But I know God would never ask a mother to sacrifice her child for the good of the world... (REALIZING) again.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car - day)
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED NOISE) Maybe I'm just being selfish. I don't know.

Homer Simpson: (MAD) You told me something, but I wasn't listening!
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry for fibbing. (CONCILIATORY) Tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home.
Homer Simpson: Fair enough! Kids, let's practice.
Homer Simpson: Mi-mi-mi-miiiii!
Lisa Simpson: (OVER EACH OTHER) Well that sucked! / There's a day we'll never get back! / I was so bored.

Grampa Simpson: That actually makes sense! Look it up!
Lisa Simpson: Sorry we missed your special day, Grampa. We'll definitely go next year.
Grampa Simpson: The thing is, I ain't got much life left to live. And a wasted day like today is one I know I'll never get back.
Homer Simpson: Oh Dad, I never knew you had dreams, or emotions.
Marge Simpson: We'll make it up to you. We'll do something you've always wanted to do but never got the chance.
Grampa Simpson: Well, there are a few things I was hopin' to do before I become dust in a jar.
Homer Simpson: Whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?
Grampa Simpson: Anyway, I made a list.

Tom O'Flanagan: Yes. I'm just an old man yellin' at me tapes.
Tom O'Flanagan: Oh, I've got lots of time for that now -- no one comes into me bar anymore. It's been years since I've sold so much as a (RHYMES WITH "MINT") pint.
Lisa Simpson: Don't you mean (PRONOUNCED CORRECTLY) "pint"?
Tom O'Flanagan: (DISTRAUGHT) It's been so long I've forgotten how to say it! It's a joke to even call this place a pube. (RHYMES WITH "RUBE")
Grampa Simpson: What happened, Tom?
Tom O'Flanagan: Everyone got jobs, that's what happened.
Homer Simpson: Sir, I brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar.

(BLARNEY CASTLE: ext. blarney castle - day - establishing)
Marge Simpson: (MOTOR-MOUTH) They say if you kiss the Blarney Stone, you get "the gift of gab." Which is great, but I'm not sure I like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing. What kind of a message is that for Lisa and Maggie? Those are my daughters. But on the other hand, America doesn't have any stones worth kissing -- except for Stone Phillips. Do you have one of him here? If so, he's our your him.
Bart Simpson: (SINGS) K-I/S-S-M-Y/A-S-S spells "kiss my ass"! (CHUCKLE)

Tom O'Flanagan: Oh, these pictures tell no lies.
Tom O'Flanagan: There's you meeting with the loan officer and the title insurance company... here's me replacing the window sashes that had termite damage, as per the escrow agreement... I have to say, for blind drunks, you had an excellent knowledge of Irish real-estate law.
Grampa Simpson: We bought this dump?
Tom O'Flanagan: You most certainly did.
Grampa Simpson: (ANNOYED NOISE)
Tom O'Flanagan: (LAUGHS AND WALKS OFF) So Long, suckers!

Homer Simpson: (TO MAN WALKING BY) Hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? (TO ANOTHER MAN PASSING BY) How about you, Greensleeves? Irishmen love to get drunk.

Bart Simpson: What you're saying is we've run out of fun things to do.
Lisa Simpson: Pretty much, yeah.

Eastern-european Woman: Leave me alone, I have a husband!
Husband: And quit sending her pianos!

Grampa Simpson: Bite your tongue! That will never, ever happen!
Homer Simpson: Well, we need help. (STROKES CHIN) Someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm.
(TOM O'FLANAGAN'S: int. tom o'flanagan's - the next day)

Moe Szyslak: No, it's how you fly coach on Delta now.
Homer Simpson: Moe, something terrible has happened! The Irish have become hardworking and sober!
Moe Szyslak: Here's how you turn this place around. (CONFIDING) I let people do things in my bar they can't do nowhere else. You wanna drink on a Sunday morning? No problem. You wanna slow-dance with a goat? I'll be doin' a lot of things, but judgin' ain't one of 'em.
Grampa Simpson: Are you sayin' we should break the law?
Moe Szyslak: (SNORTS) The law? That jerk?

Irish Guy: (WAILS) What has happened to the ways of old?

Grampa Simpson: Oh son, you know how I love a good analogy.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) It was apt.
(Courtroom: Int. courtroom - day)
Homer Simpson: Let me say I've always admired the Irish. Knute Rockne, Larry Bird, and especially Mr. Potato Head.
Irish Judge: Go on.
Kent Brockman: There you have it -- news has never been softer. (TOUCHES FINGER TO EARPIECE) What's that? The parson is here!
Homer Simpson: But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?
Homer Simpson: So I hope you'll forgive two well-meaning Americans for trying to take Ireland back to the good old days of "Angela's Ashes." Thank you.
Irish Judge: That was absolutely terrible.
Irish Judge: But fortunately for you, the punishment for your offense is deportation and a small fine.
Grampa Simpson: Thank you, Your Honor. And may I say: I'm glad I could see Ireland again, even if it isn't what I remembered.
Irish Judge: It got a lot nicer since we sent all our incompetent halfwits to America, where you, for some reason, made them police officers.

Helen Lovejoy: You asked me to quit because I was making more than you!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (SEES SOMETHING) Not now, he's here.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Welcome, Your Holiness.

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh, yeah, the bank put on a security hold after they saw a charge from an "Offshore Poker Club." Helen had bought a fireplace poker from Nova Scotia. She says it shifts logs better than American pokers, but I disagree. We'll get through it. We always do.
Parson: Well, love conquers all, huh? (KNOWING CHUCKLE) I remember when she was Helen Schwarzbaum. In fact, I remember when she was Harold Schwarzbaum.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: You what?
Parson: I've said too much. But, for the three months it took your card to go through, you weren't certified. Anything you officiated during that time: funerals, baptisms, even bingo... well, it just didn't count.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Oh, well, I'm sure the Lord is understanding...
Parson: (SUDDENLY GRIM) No he's not.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (SCARED GULP) I'll notify those affected right away.

Marge Simpson: (SENTIMENTAL) Like it was yesterday...
Marge Simpson: Kirk and Luann split up...
Marge Simpson: So Homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce...
Marge Simpson: But then you remarried us, and we were as solid as ever.
Marge Simpson: And I think Apu got lucky with my sister.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, I'm afraid that joyous occasion fell during a time when I wasn't actually a minister. Uh, since that time, you two have not been legally wed.

Marge Simpson: (MAD) Who are you calling an old lady?
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) I need that paper quick!
Bart Simpson: So you and Mom aren't married? Does that mean I'm a bastard?
Lisa Simpson: You were born while they were married so legally, no. But in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes.
Marge Simpson: It's not a big deal. We'll just go to City Hall and get married there.

Homer Simpson: Just see that my fiancée Marge gets this -- my wedding vows.
Homer Simpson: (LEANING IN) Marge! Moe and Maya are here for a double date.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. You always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is I. With each marriage I get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, I'll be worthy of you.
Homer Simpson: I miss you. I miss the kids. God help me, I even miss your sisters.
Deep Mysterious Voice: (LOUD SOBS)
Selma Bouvier: (LOUD SOBS) Poor guy! / He loves her so much!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Excuse me!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: But, I have been waiting forty-five minutes for you to slide my license over to me.
Selma Bouvier: Closed!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Okay, you are hereby banned from my store. You will have to shop at the Kwik-E-Mart across the street from me. You know, the much nicer, much newer one. (BITTER) Good day to you!
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LATER)
Lisa Simpson: Mom! Mom! We know where Dad is!
Marge Simpson: He's right here.
Homer Simpson: I'm not sure what happened. I was kidnapped, then tortured, then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. When I awoke, I felt refreshed. Then I was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn.
Marge Simpson: I'm just happy you're back. Now let's get that chain off you.
Homer Simpson: Won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?
Marge Simpson: Oh, I've missed your nonsense.
(SPINSTER ARMS: INT. SPINSTER ARMS - PATTY & SELMA'S APARTMENT - day)

Lisa Simpson: We don't want your cookies.
Hockey Announcer #2: And this game is over! Unbelievable! You'll never see anything like that again!
Bart Simpson: What she means is, we'll eat your cookies later. (THREATENING) If you don't want us to tell our Mom what you did, you're gonna have to pay.
Selma Bouvier: Pay? Pay for what?
Bart Simpson: (POINTS TO LISA) Ask her, she's the brains. (TOUGH GUY) I'm the thing that's not brains.

City Clerk: (BORED) And with the inking and application of this stamp, you are officially married. Next!

Crowd: (BIG HAPPY CHEER)
Marge Simpson: (CHOKED UP) Just what I always wanted.

Hockey Announcer #1: Hold the Black Label, Mabel! The Utica Mohawks' Pete Mavroudis has broken through the 'topes' defense!
Homer Simpson: Stop him, Babando!
Hockey Announcer #1: (EXTREME EXCITEMENT) He winds up for the shot! And Delacroix slides in front!
Marge Simpson: (SNAPPING) You're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
Homer Simpson: (WHINEY) I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends.
Hockey Announcer #1: So that will do it from Wayne Bockhorn, Jean-Pierre Pétomane, and me, Doc Jacques Lalonde, here at Utica's Kill-Kwik Rat Poison Arena.

Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: Look Marge! It's just what you want. Me spending the day with Muggsy.
Marge Simpson: (STICKS HEAD OUT DOOR) Maggie.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you're not naggy. You just set the bar impossibly high.
Marge Simpson: Can you at least bring a sweater for Maggie?
Homer Simpson: (SHAKES HEAD) Impossibly high. (TO MAGGIE) Now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever!
Homer Simpson: (SCOFFING) Not even heated up. Typical dog.
(Springfield Sidewalk: EXT. SPRINGFIELD SIDEWALK - A LITTLE LATER)
Homer Simpson: This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning.
(Moe's Tavern: EXT. moe's - daY)
Homer Simpson: Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder.
Homer Simpson: Moe, what are you doing?
Moe Szyslak: I'm spiffin' up the place! Jeez, can't a guy clean his bar for the first time ever without people makin' polite inquiries?
Moe Szyslak: Huh. I got a window here.
Homer Simpson: (REALIZING) Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. (TURNS) Whaddaya say, Maggie?

Moe Szyslak: Ah, just how I like it: warm and rusty.
Moe Szyslak: (TYPES, THEN GIGGLES AT RESPONSE, TYPES, THEN GIGGLES AT RESPONSE)
Moe Szyslak: I couldn't believe it -- I finally found an intelligent sophisticated woman who hadn't heard any of my knock-knock jokes.
Moe Szyslak: (READING OFF SCREEN) "Orange who?" (TO HIMSELF) All right Moe, give her the punchline nice and easy.
Moe Szyslak: (READING WHAT HE TYPES) Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
Moe Szyslak: The gargoyle has landed!
Moe Szyslak: (READING) "You're funny. Very nice. Now, how can I put this? Um... (TYPES) "Are you sure you're not actually some creepy guy in a public library?"
Moe Szyslak: (READING) "No. How 'bout you?" (CLEARS THROAT, THEN, TYPING) Actually, there is a much creepier guy right next to me. (SENDS)
Cat Lady: (TO MOE) You know I'm a woman. We used to own a cat together! She had babies! Here's yours!

(Library: int. library - continuous)
Moe Szyslak: Okay, this is it. I finally get to see what she looks like. Dast I click on this j-peg? No. I dasn't.

Carl Carlson: So, what does she look like?
Lenny Leonard: Whoa!
Maya: This is where I live.
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, she was a knockout. Which meant I was screwed. Because now I had to send her a picture of me.
Moe Szyslak: All right, before I send this, I'd better, uh, un-beady the eyes... de-Neanderthal the brow... smooth out my hate lines... lighten up the ear hair... switch my lips...
Moe Szyslak: Then, black tie the whole deal.
Moe Szyslak: Aw, I can't build a relationship on a lie. The lies come later.
Moe Szyslak: She thinks I'm cute?!
Moe Szyslak: (ECSTATIC) Oh frabjulous day! Calloo Callay!
Moe Szyslak: So, that's why I'm cleanin' things and flushin' things, and makin' this place look respectable.

Moe Szyslak: (SEXY) Moe's rat-free tavern! (LISTENS) Oh, ah, heya, Marge. (LISTENS) Yeah, yeah, Homer's here.
Moe Szyslak: (COVERING) Oh, you want Homer. I'm sorry, I thought you meant Himmler. Heinrich Himmler. You know, the guy who invented the Heimlich manure?
Marge Simpson: Those are two different people!
Moe Szyslak: Uh, well they're both here, and neither one's your husband. This press conference is over.
(CHILDREN'S PARK: EXT. CHILDREN'S PARK - DUSK)
Homer Simpson: Ooh, Maggie made some new friends.

Maya: Moe, I'm down here.
Moe Szyslak: (SURPRISED) Oh, you're a little person? (REGRETFUL) I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. What's the correct term?
Maya: Little person.
Moe Szyslak: (PLEASED) Whoa! Look at me bein' polite!
Maya: So, aren't you gonna invite me in?

Marge Simpson: Oh! Okay, I'm coming.
Maya: That was taken at Legoland. I was afraid you'd be disappointed in the real me.
Moe Szyslak: Are you kiddin' me? You're the best thing to come into this bar since cable TV. And unlike cable TV, I ain't stealin' you from the Chinese restaurant across the street there.
Chinese Restaurateur: I see you watch ESPN Two! I know!
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, that's great there, Ling Chow.
Moe Szyslak: So, uh, you still want to go out?

Lenny Leonard: So, when are we gonna meet her?
Moe Szyslak: (UNEASY) Oh, I can't wait till you guys get to uh...
Thought Bubble Lenny: Yep, that's what we'd do!
Moe Szyslak: Let me ask you guys somethin': how would you treat a person who's generally dynamite but uh, in some way... a little different?
Lenny Leonard: You mean like how we treat Homer?
Carl Carlson: 'Cause he can't remember limericks?
Homer Simpson: I can too! "There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh...
Barney Gumble: (LAUGH)
Carl Carlson: Look at him struggling with the simplest rhyme.
Lenny Leonard: It's a-a-b-b-a, dumbass!
Homer Simpson: There you are!
Homer Simpson: Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. (TO BULLY BABIES) Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING)
Marge Simpson: Come on, Maggie. Have some grapefruit.
Bart Simpson: She seems upset. Maybe if I lay down a beat on my bongos, that'll soothe her.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into Maggie?
Homer Simpson: (EATING) How would I know?
Marge Simpson: You've been spending so much time with her.
Homer Simpson: I have not! (REALIZING) Oh right, you think I do.

Announcer: We take images from your camera, scramble them, beam them to our orbiting satellite, unscramble them, then scramble them again, then unscramble them that all-important final time. Our competitors claim we scramble our images too much. We say, "Can you love your children too much?"
Announcer: The only thing better than Prying-Eye watching your children, is you watching your children.
Announcer: And we all know that's not gonna happen.
Marge Simpson: (GETTING IDEA NOISE)
Marge Simpson: Wait a second, Marge: do you really want to use your baby as a tool to spy on your husband?

Maya: (FLATTERED) Mese?
Moe Szyslak: Dat's right. Kiss the troll and win a prize. (POINTS TO SELF, CHUCKLES)
Maya: Listen... there's one thing that keeps bothering me.
Moe Szyslak: Is it my religion? 'Cause I am a snake handler, but not an observant one. If we have kids, they just have to have a ceremony with a cobra by age three so grandfather will be happy.
Maya: No, that's fine. It's just that I can't help wondering why you've never introduced me to anyone you know. When your mailman waved to us, you made me hide under that traffic cone.
Moe Szyslak: Well, I do know this one couple -- the Simpsons I believe their name is -- that ain't too judgmental. She's a standup dame and he's a fall-down drunk. We'll make a double date of it. Now, let's get back to what we were...

Moe Szyslak: (NERVOUS) Here she is, uh, Homer. The wonderful girl I been tellin' you about.
Homer Simpson: Pleased to meet you. (AFTER A BEAT) Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about.
Homer Simpson: In a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?
Maya: Well... If I remember my high school physics, the controlled nuclear reaction creates steam which powers a turbine...
Homer Simpson: (WHISPERS TO MOE) Man oh man, slap a ring on that!
Marge Simpson: All right, Homer. Let's see what my baby's been up to.

Moe Szyslak: Um... will you marry me?
Maya: Are you asking me to be your... (COY) little woman?
Moe Szyslak: (CHUCKLES) As long as you don't mind having a small wedding.
Maya: (CHUCKLES)

Lenny Leonard: The one time I did, I went to jail for three years.
Moe Szyslak: (DEFENSIVE) You made some good friends, didn't ya?
Lenny Leonard: Just 'cause you're chained to a guy don't make him your friend.
Moe Szyslak: Tomato, tomahto. Now how am I gonna win Maya back?
Lenny Leonard: Well, if I've learned anything from romantic comedies, is that you've got to make a grand, reckless gesture, the kind that looks like it might blow up in your face.
Moe Szyslak: But what if it blows up in my face?
Carl Carlson: With your face, who cares?

Moe Szyslak: I ain't done nothin' yet.
Moe Szyslak: But I'm considering it because I want to share your world forever.
Maya: Moe, if you have to be like me to love me, then you're not seeing the real me.
Moe Szyslak: Oh, I see you, Maya. I see you every time I look at the moon. I see ya in puddles after it rains. I see ya in the glazed eye of a barfly who's had one too many. (SAD NOISE)
Moe Szyslak: So cut me down to size, Doc. And can you wrap up the bones so my dog can have fun with 'em.

Homer Simpson: Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that'll make you smile.

Bart Simpson: When she talks to me, I feel like a better person.
Nelson Muntz: (NODS) Powerful stuff. You'd better claim her as your own. Punch her in her arm, or if you're really serious, stick gum in her hair. Here -- I always come prepared.
Nelson Muntz: Take two. You might get lucky.
Bart Simpson: (WALKING UP) Hey, Jenny.

Bart Simpson: Mom, can I get those dishes for you?
Marge Simpson: (SUSPICIOUS) What's your angle, Mister?
Bart Simpson: No angle.
Bart Simpson: Um, if this girl I'm seeing comes here, and she might, I wouldn't mind if you told her I was the kind of boy that does the dishes.

Milhouse Van Houten: But what could be more important than your best friend?
Jenny: Who's this, Bart?
Milhouse Van Houten: Oh. I see how it is. Actually, I don't. My glasses are fogged.
Milhouse Van Houten: (HORRIFIED GASP)
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, I learned some great new swear words from my uncle! He's got a broken back so he's in constant pain.
Jenny: Bart? Would you be interested in swears?
Bart Simpson: Yes, because only by knowing them can you prevent bad little kids from saying them.
Bart Simpson: (ASIDE, TO MILHOUSE) What do you want from me?!
Milhouse Van Houten: I want to know why my best friend didn't visit me like he said he would.
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, real best friends often don't speak for years at a time. Like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.
Milhouse Van Houten: Just because you saw one episode of one mini-series doesn't mean you get to use it as a whip!
Bart Simpson: Look, man. I have to keep my dark past hidden. There's someone new in my life now.
Milhouse Van Houten: Oh, I get it. It's love. I guess you found your Abigail Adams.
Bart Simpson: My who?
Milhouse Van Houten: So I'll be on my way. I can see I'm the fifth wheel on this bicycle with training wheels. But the next time I see you two I might not be able to hold my tongue.

Bart Simpson: Sorry I'm late. I didn't realize you had to turn the oven on to bake stuff.
Milhouse Van Houten: So, Jenny, I hear you're religious. Know what my favorite book of the Bible is? (OMINOUS) Revelations.
Jenny: Mine too! Bart, we should take Milhouse on our trip to juice country.
Bart Simpson: Are you nuts?! Milhouse will spill everything. By which I mean juice, not secrets!

Bart Simpson: I'm tired of talking about Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten: Hello, Bart. Surprised to see me at sea level? Well, you can't bleed out your nose when your heart's broken.
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, could you stop being creepy for just a minute?
Milhouse Van Houten: (CREEPY) No. Jenny, do you see how the dolphin in that tank seems to shy away from Bart? Why might that be?
Dolphin: (CHATTER)
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) Jenny, I can't take the pressure anymore. I have to come clean. I'm only pretending to be good...
Bart Simpson: Before I met you, I was El Barto, Skinner's Bane, the Sultan of Spitwads, the Dean of D-minus, the Ay carumba Kid!
Jenny: No, no, no, no, no!
Bart Simpson: But now I'm good because you turned me good. Isn't that all that matters?
Jenny: Are you saying our entire relationship is based on lies?
Bart Simpson: Not our entire relationship. Just the stuff I said.

Bart Simpson: (SAD MOAN)
Lisa Simpson: (WALKS UP) Bart, in my concurrent adventure, I learned a really important lesson: you can't wallow in despair. Face things as they really are.
Bart Simpson: You're right. I've gotta straighten this out.
Bart Simpson: How much for these roses, Apu?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Uh... Ten dollars.

Homer Simpson: (REALIZING) Yeah, you don't see many presidents doing that. Maybe L.B.J. -- you know, at the end.
Soccer Mom: It's not your son's fault, it's yours. You have to hover over your kid's shoulder to force him to succeed. It's called "helicopter parenting."
Homer Simpson: I don't have to "helicopter" Bart -- I've got a backup plan called "Lisa."

Bart Simpson: We'd like some balsa wood, please.
Homer Simpson: Enough to build a Washington Monument.
Clerk: What scale are you using?
Homer Simpson: (OFFENDED) What cologne are you wearing? None of your business! Now we'd like our Washington Monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.
Seymour Skinner: (LAUGHING TO HIMSELF) Washington Monument? Aren't you gonna even try?
Homer Simpson: What do you mean? And who are you?
Seymour Skinner: I'm your son's principal, and the Washington Monument is the most uninspired model choice there is. It's like saying "I don't care. My kid's a loser."
Homer Simpson: But, you...
Homer Simpson: What's the hardest model there is?
Clerk: Hmm, that would be Westminster Abbey.
Homer Simpson: Attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. My son and I are going to build (DRAMATICALLY) Westminster Abbey!
Helicopter Parents: You've got to be crazy! / Prepare to be frustrated!
Kirk Van Houten: You won't get past the north transept!
Homer Simpson: Hey, how hard can it be? All we have to do is follow the directions.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - day - establishing)
Homer Simpson: Marge, the boy and I will be making Westminster Abbey.

Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Brittany and Kaitlin are here! Where's my spray-on tan?
Homer Simpson: (UPSET) Ant poison? (MOANS) Why do I always read the labels after?
Homer Simpson: (TO GIRLS) Ladies, we've got it all. Rhinestones, stickers, tassels... everything to make those hundred dollar phones look like five dollar toys.
Brittany: Lisa! This party is twisted!
Kaitlin: You're fierce!
Lisa Simpson: (PLEASED CHUCKLE) I've never been called "fierce" before. "Strident..." "hectoring" has been tossed around...
Ashley: Let me take a picture of you for my cell phone. (SHE DOES)
Kaitlin: I'll put you on my desktop! (TAKES PICTURE)
Brittany: (USING PHONE) I'm gonna make you my friend on Facebook. Please confirm.
Lisa Simpson: (USING PHONE) Confirm.
Brittany: (LOUD SQUEAL OF DELIGHT)
Homer Simpson: I am such a great parent to both my kids.
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Hello, little girl, who do you belong to?
Homer Simpson: Hey boy, why don't I do that for you?
Bart Simpson: Isn't this supposed to be my project?
Homer Simpson: All the other parents are doing it for their kids. Now stand back and I'll take it from here. A little further back.
Bart Simpson: Do you want me to watch and learn?
Homer Simpson: Naw, that kinda creeps me out.
Homer Simpson: Must finish Poet's Corner... or Bart will work for Noah... with his hot mom...
Homer Simpson: (SNORING NOISES)
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) That's not Henry the Seventh, it's Henry the Sixth! Stupid, stupid, stupid!
GHOST: (BRITISH ACCENT) Homer, don't give up till you finish my dear Abbey.
Homer Simpson: Geoffrey Chaucer?! What are you doing here?
Chaucer's Ghost: Well I'm buried here! And I want to tell you, you're right to do all Bart's work for him. It's the best thing for the boy.
Female Ghost: (BRITISH ACCENT) That's terrible advice.
Homer Simpson: Anne of Cleves!
Female Ghost: What you do for your son, he'll never learn to do for himself.
ELEGANTLY-DRESSED GHOST: (LIKE DR. SMITH FROM "LOST IN SPACE") Oh, and where is this delightful boy?
Homer Simpson: Oscar Wilde?
Oscar Wilde: Homer, there are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.
Homer Simpson: But that makes no sense!
Oscar Wilde: "Experience" is simply the name we give to our mistakes.
Homer Simpson: (AGGRAVATED) Shut up!
Oscar Wilde: These days, man knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
Homer Simpson: Whatever happened to "boo?"

Homer Simpson: Yes! Yes! In your face, losers! This helicopter is taking off! ("WOOSH WOOSH WOOSH" HELICOPTER NOISES)
Bart Simpson: No! Stop the hovering!
Homer Simpson: (HELICOPTER SLOWING DOWN NOISE)
Bart Simpson: (CONFESSING) I didn't make this terrible model... my dad did.
Crowd: (GASPS)
Bart Simpson: Why can't you guys let us do things for ourselves. In the words of Oscar Wilde: "Experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes." I saw him too, Dad.
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry. I got carried away. From now on the only thing I'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. But at least I made Lisa popular.
Homer Simpson: "I H-8 this?" (PUZZLED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry, Dad. These girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. I hope you understand.
Homer Simpson: (NODS) Yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing I can do as a parent is simply check out.
Lisa Simpson: No, there's a middle ground.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, a light bulb is either on or it's off.
Lisa Simpson: Not if you use a dimmer switch.
Homer Simpson: That's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - foyer - day)
Marge Simpson: What's wrong, Homie?

Marge Simpson: Well, I know a place in this house where you can really relax.
Homer Simpson: That mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?

Science Water Promoter: Nourish... Vitality... Purple... Potato-Lime... I Love The Nineties... New Car Smell...
Marge Simpson: Excuse me, I'm feeling a little... over-hydrated.

Ralph Wiggum: Class, in what year was one plus one?
Ralph Wiggum: The answer is: "The Amazing Ralph"!
Marge Simpson: The only person getting an education here today was me! In how bad it is!
Seymour Skinner: Mrs. Simpson, let me pour you a drink.
Seymour Skinner: (OFFERING) Scotch? Vodka? Gin? I've got everything you want.

Milhouse Van Houten: My cousin goes to a much better school. He lives in Waverly Hills.
Lisa Simpson: (ADMIRING) Oh, their school system's the best. Their auditorium and their gym are two different rooms!
Milhouse Van Houten: (GASP)
Homer Simpson: We can't afford to move to Waverly Hills! Their house prices have commas in them. As it is, our lawn is just green-painted cement.
Santa's Little Helper: (FRUSTRATED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: (SAD) I just wish I could go to a school like that -- even for one week. "Tis better to have learned and lost then never to have learned at all."
Marge Simpson: What if we got a small apartment there? We wouldn't have to live in it, but we would have a Waverly Hills address.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, that's brilliant! We could go to a school where special doesn't always mean bad! And where the teachers don't have to moonlight as telemarketers.

Marge Simpson: (QUICKLY, STARTLED) The what?
City Clerk: It's just a formality to make sure you actually live here. (LEANS IN) Some people use the address just so their kids can go to our schools.
Homer Simpson: (FAKING INDIGNATION) Ha! I can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. How I despise them.

(Ginormous Pictures: int. Ginormous Pictures - producer's office - continuous)
Producer: Homer, we have a problem.
Homer Simpson: Fine. I'll give back the Oscars I stole from the lobby.
Homer Simpson: Do you want the Golden Globe?
Producer: No. Nooo.
Producer: But we have a bigger problem.
Director #1: Homer, my brother and I showed this picture of you to a cross-section of typical moviegoers.
Director #2: Not one thought you looked like a superhero.
Director #1: Several people stared at the sun, attempting to blind themselves.
Director #2: Stared at the sun. Against every animal instinct they had.
Producer: We need you to slim down, muscle up and become the "Everyman" people want to be instead of the one they actually are.
Homer Simpson: I don't know if I can. I'm a yo-yo dieter: "Yo, hot dog man!" "Yo, peanuts!" (CHUCKLES, THEN SERIOUS) Why aren't you laughing? Don't you know what "yo" means?
Lyle McCarthy: Maybe...I can help Lyle McCarthy.
Homer Simpson: Finally, the answer to my problem. What do you do?
Director #1: He's the trainer to the stars.
Lyle McCarthy: Here's what Brad and Angelina looked like before they met me.
Homer Simpson: Hm, they look good with a little meat on their bones.
Lyle McCarthy: Come with me.
Producer: Him? He's gone Hollywood.
(STAHL CASE STUDY HOUSE: ext. stahl case study house - pool - night)
Comic Book Guy: A lot of people have come to this town and changed. But not me.
HOLLYWOOD HIPSTERS: (IMPRESSED NOISES)
Comic Book Guy: Now excuse me, I have to read a story to my adopted Cambodian baby.
Comic Book Guy: Nannies, produce the child and the story!
Comic Book Guy: Hello, Prius -- give daddy a kiss. (KISSES BOY)
(Simpson Home: int. Simpson house - day)
Lyle McCarthy: Homer, do you know why you eat?
Homer Simpson: (GUESSING) Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
Lyle McCarthy: Something bad happens and you cope by cramming a donut in your mouth.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate (MASTURBATE BEEPED-OUT).
Lyle McCarthy: I'm gonna teach you healthy emotional alternatives to eating. We don't have much time, so we'll do it in a montage to the song "Eye of the Tiger."
Homer Simpson: Oh, that song's a little on the nose. Can we do it to David Bowie's "Heroes?"
Lyle McCarthy: Yeah, it's your montage.
Homer Simpson: This montage sounds really exhausting. How 'bout I just do a walking around sad montage?
Lyle McCarthy: No.
Homer Simpson: A montage of me turning a ragtag Little League team into state runners-up?
Lyle McCarthy: No.
Homer Simpson: Me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? Then I get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then I see the driver is a chicken?
Lyle McCarthy: Let's just skip ahead a month.
(PRIVATE GYM: Int. private gym - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (DOING PUSH-UPS) Ten thousand one, ten thousand two... aaaand fit. (LEAPS TO HIS FEET)
Lyle McCarthy: I gotta take this. (INTO PHONE) Tobey! Cider house rules! (TO HOMER, UNDER BREATH) Total wuss. (THEN, INTO PHONE) Seabiscuit, you keepin' off the sugar cubes? (TO HOMER, WHISPERS) I hate this guy. (THEN, INTO PHONE) I love this guy! Tobe, Tobe, Tobe, we talked about this -- if the rice ain't brown, don't chow down! Look, I gotta bail, I'm with Everyman right now. No, no, no, no, no don't worry, he totally sucks! (TO HOMER, WHISPERS) I'm only lying to him. (INTO PHONE) Goodbye! (TO HOMER, WHISPERS) Bad-bye.
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) Was that Tobey Maguire?
Homer Simpson: But how will I keep from overeating?
Lyle McCarthy: Hey, Home Town Buffet, like I told John Travolta, my client list is private. You know what, enough chitchat. Hit the pole!
Lyle McCarthy: Stripper up! Fireman down!
Lyle McCarthy: (SEXILY) And sexy! (HEROIC) Heroic! (SEXILY) Sexy! (HEROIC) Heroic! (SEXILY) And sexy! (HEROIC) Heroic! Earn that money!
Homer Simpson: Found this on the roof.
(SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE: Int. SPRINGFIELD soundstage - day)
Police Chief: Well, I think we've seen the last of the Purple Pariah. Thanks, Everyman!
Everyman: Don't thank me -- thank Captain America...for giving me the patriotism to want to save the President's life. And thank Wonder Woman....for giving me the boobs to distract the guards.
Director #1: And cut!
Homer Simpson: What'd you think, kids?
Bart Simpson: That was awesome!
Lisa Simpson: Although there were a few holes in the story.
Director #2: That's the problem when you have seventeen writers. But don't worry, we have two fresh ones working on it.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - night - establishing)
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homie... take your shirt off again.
Marge Simpson: (TURNED-ON NOISE) There's less of you to love, but I love you even more.
Marge Simpson: What was that?!
Homer Simpson: Your other hand. (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: (SWOONING) Ooh.
(Springfield: Ext. Springfield - top of a city building - day)
Director #2: Cut! Terrific. Bring in the next helicopter.
Director #1: Awesome performance, Homer. I smell Oscar.
Director #1: Oscar! Take a shower! Or a tomato bath, or something. Please!
Homer Simpson: This life is the greatest. I get paid a fortune, I've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and I get to hire my friends.
Lenny Leonard: At least you get to see my face, unlike Carl.
Carl Carlson: (MUFFLED) I'm being paid to do what I love!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) A lot of things come and go in life. But not fame and fitness.
Lyle McCarthy: Homer? Homer Sapian! Can I have a word with you? I know this is a bad time, but I'm leaving for another gig.
Homer Simpson: (BITTERLY) Is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
Lyle McCarthy: Don't take it personally, Home-team.
Lyle McCarthy: Just remember what I taught you.
Homer Simpson: But you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
Lyle McCarthy: I have taught you well. Goodbye!
Homer Simpson: (CHOKED UP) He's gone.
Homer Simpson: One cheese cube couldn't hurt.
Homer Simpson: Oh. This other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. Well, that still technically counts as one.
Homer Simpson: It's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes.
Homer Simpson: (EATING NOISES, THEN, SOBS:) Don't look at me. Don't look at me!
Homer Simpson: (BEAT) You. You watch. (RESUMES EATING)
(Ballroom: Int. ballroom - night)
Leading Lady: Avery, I swear, you're the only man in Gothamopolis who's never seen Everyman.
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) Well, one thing's for sure: I'm not Everyman.
Director #2: Cut!
Director #1: (SOTTO) This is a disaster!
Director #2: (SOTTO) I'm getting a bad feeling about this film: the star's overweight, we're way over-budget, and the grasshopperaptor we built seems to have developed an evil mind of its own.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - night - establishing)
Homer Simpson: Oh Marge! I'm ready for some lovin'!
Marge Simpson: (SEXY) Come and get me.
Marge Simpson: (WOOZY NOISE)
Homer Simpson: Marge, speak to me.
Marge Simpson: I think you may have put on a little weight.
Homer Simpson: Nag, nag, nag.
(Kwik-E-Mart: ext. Kwik-E-Mart - day - establishing)
Homer Simpson: Apu, I have to lose weight now. Do you have anything that'll make me vomit?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (COYLY) Well, I don't know. I might have some milk that has expired.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Ah, here we are... a delightful buttermilk from nineteen sixty-one.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh, sixty-one. Everyone was twisting again like they did the previous summer.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (OMINOUS) Whatever you do, do not chew the chunks.
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH HALF-FULL, WORRIED) Uh-oh.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Hoo boy. (SPEAKS INTO MICROPHONE) Clean up in aisles three... two... one...
(SPRINGFIELD SOUNDSTAGE: Int. springfield soundstage - day)
Director #1: And action! (LOOKS AROUND) Cut! Where's Homer?
Director #2: In his trailer.
Director #1: He won't come out?
Director #2: He can't come out.
Comic Book Guy: This film is an embarrassment of Jar-Jarrian magnitude!
Comic Book Guy: As the writer, I demand to express my opinion!
Security Guard: I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.
Comic Book Guy: I see. Well, I respect that and... Vulcan death grip!
Security Guard: Hollywood ponytail yank!
Studio Heads: (HELLISH WAIL)
Former Studio Head: My only sin was believing in George Clooney!
Studio Heads: (ANOTHER HELLISH WAIL)
(Aztec Theater: ext. aztec movie theater - day)
Homer Simpson: How ya doin', man?
Female Producer: (WORRIED) I think we have a clunker here. And I should know, I produced "Bad Summer Movie," the parody of bad summer movies that was itself a bad summer movie.
Director #1: Don't worry, we fixed everything with editing.
Director #2: Editing solves everything. Except my problems with the I.R.S.
Director #1: Yeah, how's that going?
Dr. Reptilicus: Everyman! Show yourssself!
Homer Simpson: I'm right here! I've been here all along!
Lenny Leonard: Half the shots he's fat, half the shots he's thin. It's taking me out of the moment. Like when you're kissing a girl and she burps.
Carl Carlson: Who was in charge of continuity on this picture?
Lady: I tried to show them the Polaroids -- they wouldn't look!
Carl Carlson: It's your job to get their attention! Nobody takes responsibility anymore.
Lady: Well, I... I just wanted to get back into the business after I had my kids.
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, well, now those kids have an embarrassment for a mother.
(Theater: Ext. theater - a short time later)
Lyle McCarthy: Homeboy!
Lyle McCarthy: What happened, dude? You went from Everyman to Everywhereman.
Homer Simpson: What happened is you left! Who did you leave me for? (BREAKING DOWN) Tell me. I can take it. (SOBS)
Lyle McCarthy: (SERIOUS) Okay. It was Turtle from "Entourage."
Homer Simpson: I knew it!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (DEPRESSED GROAN)
Lyle McCarthy: Come on, Home Run. It's okay, Home Alone. Look, I'm sorry. Let me make this up to you. I'll train you. Then leave you again. Then come back and train you.
Lyle McCarthy: It's how I make my money.
Homer Simpson: Just you and me?
Lyle McCarthy: (SHRUGS) You, me and Turtle.
Homer Simpson: (A LITTLE INTRIGUED) That could work.
Lyle McCarthy: He is a great guy. (LOUD WHISPER, TO HOMER) He's an awful guy.
Homer Simpson: You just said both those things to me.
Lyle McCarthy: I'm sorry. (LOUD WHISPER, TO HOMER) I'm not sorry.
Producer: Look Comic Book Guy, about the movie... we know it's not great.
Director #1: Yeah, the projectionist hung himself with the final reel.
Director #2: But you created "Everyman." Your fans will think whatever you tell them.
Producer: If you put the word out that this movie is good, we'll let you direct the sequel!
Comic Book Guy: (TEMPTED, IN AWE) You would let me direct "Everyman 2: Rise of the Revenge"?
Producer: (NODS) Absolutely -- all you have to do is tell your army of internet dweebs to go see this movie.
Comic Book Guy: (PONDERING) Sell my soul for Hollywood lucre or stay true to my lofty ideals.
(The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop: int. android's dungeon - later that night)
Comic Book Guy: "Everyman" the motion picture is the culmination of a lifelong dream. And I was one of the few who saw that dream realized on screen last night. If there is one fault to find with this two hundred million dollar production, it is that this is...
Comic Book Guy: (EMPHATIC) ...the worst. Movie. Ever! And "send!"
Comic Book Guy: And sip!
(MOUNTAINTOP: Ext. mountaintop - day)
Announcer: Though legislation was passed to insure Everyman was never seen on screens again, he remains in the hearts of every man, woman and child looking for justice. Or just hoping to see bad people beaten up.

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (SHEEPISH) Hey, don't worry, we still have the good old classroom computer!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Who wants to play "Word Jammers"?

Bart Simpson: Maybe Mrs. K would be nicer if we "Irish" up her coffee.
Nelson Muntz: Put blood in it?
Fbi Supervisor: No.
Bart Simpson: No, booze. First the easy part: kids, get some liquor.
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. springfield elementary - day)
Nelson Muntz: Hurry! She's almost done flirting with the vending machine guy!
Milhouse Van Houten: What if she tastes the booze?
Bart Simpson: Relax. Hazelnut creamer covers all sins.
Milhouse Van Houten: And that's why I found "Goodnight Gorilla" to be the perfect summer beach read.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (TIPSY) Two stars for you.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (TIPSY) And an extra, 'cause you're gonna have a hard life.

Seymour Skinner: Edna, let's go.

Nelson Muntz: Nah. Booze only makes you do things you already wanted to do.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm queen of the world!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (REMORSEFUL) I'm so sorry. I really don't know what happened.
Seymour Skinner: You made quite a nanny goat of yourself yesterday!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I know I did, but I don't know why.
Seymour Skinner: (SIGHS) This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But I'm letting you go.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Seymour... I'm gonna cry.
Seymour Skinner: (KINDLY) Here, take my hanky.
Zack: Yes, you have. What are these?
Bart Simpson: All thanks to... "The Answer"!

Seymour Skinner: Of course.
Seymour Skinner: (UNDER BLANKET) There's a form to extend your health insurance on my desk.

Bart Simpson: ...then Zack Skyped us, live-blogged our spelling bee, and friended us on Facebook!
Lisa Simpson: I thought you were studying the Lincoln-Douglas debates?
Bart Simpson: You mean the L-man-D-dog flame wars?
Lisa Simpson: (GROANS)
Marge Simpson: I'm glad you've got such a stimulating substitute, but I'm worried about Mrs. Krabappel.
Bart Simpson: Oh, no worries. I heard on the four-square court she's doin' great.
Lisa Simpson: (EXASPERATED) No one even plays four-square anymore -- they just gossip.
(Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom: Int. Bart's class - day)
Zack: (PEPPY) All right, who can tell me what the Monroe doctrine was?
Martin Prince: The policy of President Monroe, that America has the right as a nation to...

Martin Prince: I-I... I've crammed my head full of garbage!

Milhouse Van Houten: (STUNNED) Oh my God!
Zack: (RE: SMILEY FACE STICKERS) Anybody want to return these caveman kudos to Mrs. Krabappel?

Bart Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) It's the movie. (POINTS TO TV) It's so funny.
BIG-BUSTED DOWAGER: (INDIGNANT) Sir, this is a benefit to increase our endowment.

Bart Simpson: Well, that's better than me. But still, you've gotta get out.

Homer Simpson: I'm not asking for A's. Just incompletes.
Zack: Mr. Simpson, I don't need your money. Bart can definitely be a challenge, but I like challenges. And he... (LAUGHING) he's got a wild sense of humor. Look at this picture he drew:
Zack: (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: (TO SELF) It will be his last birthday if he keeps drawing pictures like this.
Zack: What?
Homer Simpson: I said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?
Zack: Yes. Just one: relax. You're clearly a caring father.

Bart Simpson: There's got to be some other way to help Mrs. K.

Willis: Oh my.
Australian Woman: "The Answer" was discovered by the philosophers of ancient Greece, who hid it under a rock where it was discovered by the knights of King Arthur, who placed it in a bottle and set it in the ocean, where it was found by Pat Sajak.
Australian Woman: These great men knew the answer:
Australian Woman: The Answer is the secret to achieving your heart's desire.
Australian Woman: Learn "The Answer" and change your life.

Bart Simpson: Well, Mrs. K. I have just the book slash DVD for you. (WHISPERS DRAMATICALLY) "The Answer."

Bart Simpson: (READING) "Break your dream down into smaller 'wishes,' then break those down into 'wish-able actions.'"
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart, this is starting to sound like one of those loony self-help books.

Bart Simpson: Well, I guess I can tell you... 'cause everything worked out for the best...
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Everything? What everything?
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Well, it's funny, really. I'm the one who put booze in your coffee and got you fired. (CHUCKLES)

Bart Simpson: Noooo!
Bart Simpson: But-but-but, you found "The Answer!"
Bart Simpson: Nooo! I wrote a phone number in there!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: No matter what you've done, I always thought there was a spark of decency in you, Bart Simpson. But I was wrong. I never thought I'd say this to a child, but you are bad on the inside.
Bart Simpson: (STUNNED GASP)
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's bedroom - day)
Bart Simpson: Dad... am I bad on the inside?
Homer Simpson: No... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
Bart Simpson: But you think there's like a kernel of good inside me, right?
Martin Prince: (SCARED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: (UNSURE) Hm, I don't know -- kernels are kind of big.
Bart Simpson: (SAD SIGH) Listen... I was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?
Homer Simpson: When you say "teacher," do you really mean "parent?"
Bart Simpson: No, I mean teacher.
Homer Simpson: Great. Go nuts. But remember, we never had this discussion.
Bart Simpson: (KNOWING) What discussion?
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED) The one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! (THEN, GETTING IT) Ohhh.

Bart Simpson: ...so you see, it was my fault. I got Mrs. Krabappel drunk. And then I was gonna do the same thing to Zack, but I decided it was better to just tell the truth.
Seymour Skinner: Bart, you deserve a reward for telling the truth, and that reward will be in the form of a severe punishment.
Bart Simpson: Doesn't matter, as long as Edna gets her job back.
Seymour Skinner: Sorry, Bart. But I can't just get rid of a teacher if he's doing a good job. Or an adequate job. Or just shows up and doesn't touch anyone.
Zack: (CHANTING) I hate child-ren! I hate child-ren! Chil-dren suck! Chil-dren suck!

Seymour Skinner: Bart, you said you didn't get him drunk.
Bart Simpson: I didn't. I swear!
Zack: No, he's right. (CONSPIRATORIAL) I mixed a little vodka in with my Blue Bronco.

Zack: Y'owwwww!
Groundskeeper Willie: (SEEN IT ALL) It's always the good ones that go crazy the fastest.
Zack: Get off me! You can get rid of me, but you can't get rid of the truth, man! This school is a glorified hamster wheel run by incompetent bureaucrats who can get you through a test -- but you will fail the test of life!
Seymour Skinner: Children! Fingers in your ears and makes the "la-la" sound.
Zack: Every class is a joke. English, a joke! Homeroom, a joke! Free period, a joke! Nutritious lunch, a joke!

Marge Simpson: I googled "girls having fun," and after wading through ninety-seven thousand pages of porn, I found "crazy bowling."
Marge Simpson: That's odd. There isn't a single man in this whole bowling alley.
Cat Lady: (CRAZY RANTS)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: It's pretty sad when I can't pick up a guy on Super-Nacho Tuesday. Where'd they all go?

Homer Simpson: (WINE CONNOISSEUR) Ah yes, filthy, but obscure. With a subtle scatological undertone.
Autograph-signing Fighter: Sure, no problem. Twenty-five dollars, please.
Homer Simpson: Pay the man, boy.
Homer Simpson: Now listen, son, I know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. Do it at the schoolyard. Someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass Joe Biden.

Marge Simpson: God didn't give you legs so you could use them as scissors!
Bart Simpson: I was just doing the moves I learned from Ultimate Punching!

Marge Simpson: (TO BART, NELSON AND ULTIMATE PUNCHING SPECTATORS, DETERMINED) Okay, I'm going to put a stop to this "Ultimate Punching."
Nelson Muntz: You can't stop an entire sport! You'd need several other mothers, some sympathetic school officials and clergymen...
Marge Simpson: Uh-huh...
Nelson Muntz: A place to meet...
Marge Simpson: Uh-huh...
Nelson Muntz: Some snacks...
Marge Simpson: What else?
Nelson Muntz: A phone tree is invaluable. How you fixed for staplers? Those fliers don't stick to phone poles by themselves, you know.
Marge Simpson: Nelson, you really have a knack for this.
Nelson Muntz: (SHRUGS MODESTLY) Well, when I grow up, I hope to go into event planning.

Bart Simpson: Mom, don't do this! This sport is as fun for me as having kids is for you!
Bart Simpson: Tell her, Dad! You love Ultimate Punching even more than I do!
Homer Simpson: (SLIGHTLY ROBOTIC) Ultimate Punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. Studies have shown your mother is right.
Bart Simpson: (CONFUSED) What the?
Bart Simpson: Chocolate, whipped cream... cherries! (POINTS TO MARGE) She got to you! With a piece of black forest cake!

Male Crowd: (FEROCIOUS BOOS)
Marge Simpson: At least in other sports they're trying to put a ball in a net or a zone. But in this sport they don't put anything in anything. And if they did, I wouldn't want to see it!
Chett: Okay, you win.
Male Crowd: (SHOCKED DISBELIEF)
Chett: Annoying lady, you make a great point. I am going to shut down this sport...

Carl Carlson: (OFFENDED) What? You think just 'cause I'm black I know all other black people?

Bart Simpson: Right. Like we agreed.
Lisa Simpson: I never said "kill!"
Bart Simpson: Yeah, 'cause you're smart. You don't say "kill," you say "prank." Like Mom and Dad say "snuggle" when what they really mean is "let's lock the door and hug."
Lisa Simpson: Well, I didn't kill Mrs. Krabappel!
Bart Simpson: (SCARY LOUD BELCH)
Bart Simpson: (SHOCKED DISBELIEF) So all you did was ring her doorbell and run?

Lisa Simpson: (CHUCKLES)
Bart Simpson: Dad... I want a baby brother.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Son, I love you kids. But I'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and I ain't comin' out.
Bart Simpson: Lisa got a sister! Why can't you have another boy?
Homer Simpson: Girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and I don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause I don't know.
Bart Simpson: You never told me how my body works.
Homer Simpson: Point and shoot.
(Evergreen Terrace: EXT. evergreen terrace - bus stop - day)
Bart Simpson: My Dad is such a jerk. I want a brother and he said no.

Marge Simpson: (SMITTEN) Oh what a lovely evening.
Homer Simpson: (FLIRTY) And it's not over yet.

Bart Simpson: (PEPPY) Hope you saved room for passion fruit soufflé with crème anglais for two.
Bart Simpson: And one for mom.
Marge Simpson: (DELIGHTED GASPS)
Homer Simpson: There comes a time in every marriage when it comes down to this. Do we eat dessert or do we make love?
Marge Simpson: (OPTIMISTIC) Maybe we could do both.
Homer Simpson: Yeah!
Homer Simpson: We couldn't do both.
Marge Simpson: No... we could not.
Bart Simpson: (FRUSTRATED NOISE)
Bart Simpson: Are you sure this'll work?
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, this is the DVD my parents used to make me.

Homer Simpson: (INTRIGUED) Hm, people in other countries make love? It's about time.
Marge Simpson: Which position should we try?
Marge Simpson: "The Yawning Monkey?" "The Pair Of Tongs?"

Kearney Zzyzwicz: Nice loog! / Wish I'd hocked that!
Bart Simpson: Look, I want a baby brother, but I can't get my parents to do it.
Jimbo Jones: Here's the thing, Simpson. No matter how dead their relationship seems, all parents eventually commit the heinous act of love.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Mine do it once a year on the magical day when the prison and the insane asylum have their annual mixer.
Jimbo Jones: What you've got to worry about is the pill.
Bart Simpson: The pill? What's that?
Kearney Zzyzwicz: It's medicine doctors give moms to keep babies up in Heaven.
Bart Simpson: Well, I need a baby now and I'm not getting any younger!
DOLPH: Then get rid of the pills.
Bart Simpson: Got it. How can I thank you?
DOLPH: Uh... give yourself a wedgie.
Bart Simpson: Don't you wanna do it?
DOLPH: Can't.
DOLPH: Carpal-nurple syndrome. The doctor said if I didn't take it easy, I might never shove a kid's face in the drinking fountain again.

Bart Simpson: I just wanted a baby brother, but Dad said I was one "Uday" who didn't need a "Qusay." (SADLY) I just wanted what Lisa and Maggie have.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Barty, I'm sorry. But your father and I think that three kids is just perfect.
Homer Simpson: Holy moly!
Bart Simpson: (POUTING) What about what I want? (ENTREATING) I'd help you take care of him.
Marge Simpson: Remember those hamsters you were going to take care of?
Bart Simpson: Oh my God, the hamsters!
Marge Simpson: ("CONSIDER THIS") And even if we did have another baby, it might not be a boy. (SLY) It might be another sister.
Bart Simpson: Another sister!
New Sister: Hey, you didn't see what I cooked up in the galley of my last flight to London. They don't call it "Virgin" Airlines anymore.

Bart Simpson: Nice! Favorite Beatle?

Grampa Simpson: (PROUDLY) I'm hangin' on every word.
Homer Simpson: Fortunately there was one man who could help: Colonel Tom Parker. The Colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name "The Rolling Stones." The first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. But those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen.

Agnes Skinner: A little. But as an Olympic curler, he's dragging us down like an anchor on a bag of toasters.
Marge Simpson: But Homer tries his best.
Agnes Skinner: We know. That's why we're positive he'll never get any better. I had one Olympics ruined by a bald, drooling idiot but it's not gonna happen again. (GESTURES TO SEYMOUR)
Seymour Skinner: (SNAPPING) I was not bald! My fontanel was covered by lanugo!
Agnes Skinner: Whatever. We want Homer off the team.

Marge Simpson: Boo yeah!
Agnes Skinner: Well, no matter what you do, it won't make up for Sir Slip-a-lot over there.
Homer Simpson: Uh-oh.
Marge Simpson: Yes it will. I'll just sweep harder than anyone's ever swept before. Because without Homer I'm a broom without a stone. No use for anything.
Agnes Skinner: Wow. That's love, Seymour. I'm glad you saw it once before you died.
Bob Costas: If Homer Simpson doesn't land this stone in center house, the only gold they'll be going home with is Lisa's pin collection.

Homer Simpson: (WHISPERS) Alcoholics.
Lisa Simpson: There must have been some good ancestors -- Grampa, don't you know any?
Grampa Simpson: Not a one! Maybe the nicest was Abigail Simpson, who you know as the Pittsburgh Poisoner...
Homer Simpson: Listen, Lisa. You're gonna find more than you bargained for. If I were you, I wouldn't dig into the past. I lived in some of that past, and I got out for a reason.
Lisa Simpson: I won't give up. I have to know that somewhere in the muck and the mire and the Pittsburgh Poisoners, this family had a noble spark. And I will find it, even if I have to go back to Adam and Eve.

Eliza: Just one. When I was a girl, I witnessed a grave injustice... but I held my tongue. That pat on my head from a wicked man has haunted me to this day.
Lisa Simpson: (TEARFULLY) There's no noble Simpson.
(Simpson Home: ext. Simpson house - day - establishing)
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) You were right, Dad. I should have quit while I was ahead, instead of learning the horrible truth about our family and Virgil.
Grampa Simpson: Aw, don't cry, meat pie. Things worked out pretty well for Virgil in the end.
Lisa Simpson: What are you talking about? Is there something you know about Virgil that you haven't told us?
Grampa Simpson: I'll take that secret to my grave! Or urn, or medical school dissecting table, or wherever you're dumpin' me!
Homer Simpson: Listen, Wrinkles! If you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. Or I can make things very uncomfortable for you.
Grampa Simpson: (PANICKY) Okay, I'll talk! D-Day is June 6th! Repeat: June 6th! Allied forces will land on the beaches of Normandy in the following order: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno... are you writing this down, Fritz?
Homer Simpson: About Virgil.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, right. Well Lisa, Mabel knew her husband well, so she had cooked up a little "payback pie..."
(OLD SIMPSON HOUSE: ext. Old SIMPSON HOUSE - day (1860))
C. Montgomery Burns: (STARTLED NOISE)
Mabel: Get off my property, Colonel Burns! And if I ever see you in these parts again, (COCKS SHOTGUN) you're gonna be a Memphis belle.
Colonel Burns: Very well. You may have won this round. But some day my history will be told, by my descendants Ken and Rick Burns.
Mabel: I knew you'd break your promise! Now I'm taking Virgil to freedom!
Virgil Simpson: You defied your husband for me? Man, this is the sixties.
Mabel: Now let's take you to a place where a black man can blend in: Canada.
Grampa Simpson: So with those words, Mabel and Virgil headed north.
(Country Road: ext. country road - early evening)
Grampa Simpson: But their journey was fraught with peril...
Virgil Simpson: (SIGHS) Mabel, why don't I go on alone, and you go back to Hiram?
Mabel: No! There's no life for me with him! I just need to disguise my hair... but how?
Abraham Lincoln: May I be of assistance?
Mabel: Abraham Lincoln?! (GASPS)
Abraham Lincoln: Perhaps this hat will help disguise your hair.
Mabel: Thank you. (PUTS IT ON OVER HAIR) How's it look?
Abraham Lincoln: It makes you look like a potbellied stove.
Mabel: (ANNOYED NOISE)
Abraham Lincoln: (OFF HER ANNOYED LOOK) Hey, hey, "Honest Abe." (CHUCKLES) Oh, I'm a riot.
(Niagara Falls: ext. niagara falls - day)

Grampa Simpson: ...and got one of his shoes in the settlement...Mabel and Virgil lived out the rest of their days in peace.
(MODEST SNOW-COVERED HOUSE: ext. modest snow-covered house - day - establishing)
Grampa Simpson: They got married, and since Virgil had no last name, they both took the name Simpson, so that Mabel could keep all her monogrammed table linens.
(Hallway: int. hallway - continuous)
Grampa Simpson: And their son, Abraham Simpson, was my great-grandfather.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - day (A LITTLE LATER))
Grampa Simpson: So you're actually descended from Virgil, not Hiram. Are ya happy?
Lisa Simpson: Yes! I'm thrilled! We've regained our family honor and (TO BART) we're one-sixty-fourth black!
Bart Simpson: So that's why I'm so cool!
Lisa Simpson: That's why my jazz is so smooth!
Homer Simpson: And that's why I earn less than my white co-workers!
Lisa Simpson: Grampa, why'd you try to keep us from finding this out?
Grampa Simpson: Well, it's hard to explain this to a young person, but people of my generation are... you know...
Lisa Simpson: Racists?
Grampa Simpson: That's it.
Marge Simpson: I don't know what the big deal is. I mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's French. You know, Bouvier?
Homer Simpson: So that's why I love drinking so much.
Marge Simpson: I'm French, not you.
Homer Simpson: (SHRUGGING) C'est la vie, baby.
Narrator: How will the Springfielder of the future get around town? Will he be like Bus-stop Bill, caught out in the rain?
Narrator: Or will he be like Subway Sam, packed like a tuna, on the Springfield Metro Line?
Narrator: (POSITIVE) Here he can rub shoulders with fellow businessmen and share their deadly germs!
Narrator: These two men might as well be kissing! Is there no way to get to work in comfort, safety, and style?
Narrator: Well, it looks like Motorcar Mel's got the answer! He's cruising at a hundred and thirty miles an hour in a plutonium-powered auto on the spacious skyway of tomorrow.
Narrator: And it's got plenty of room for all of Mrs. Mel's shopping.
Narrator: All that's left is to pick Junior up from school.
Narrator: Looks like that robot arm needs a little adjustment. (CHUCKLES)

Bart Simpson: Sixth-graders! Nooooooo!
Milhouse Van Houten: We had to build a Hopi Indian pueblo.
Martin Prince: Mine features indigenous Hopi songs.
Hopi Singers: (NATIVE AMERICAN SINGING) NA HI HIE HO HEY...!
Martin Prince: What's this? A promoter has arrived to entice the tribe to perform in a wild west show!
Martin Prince: Unfortunately, the chief doesn't read the contract very carefully.
Martin Prince: The good news is, over a hundred years later, a brilliant little boy receives an "A" for his amazing presentation.

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (CLAPPING) Bravo, Martin! Bravo!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well let's see what the rest of you dullards have to offer.
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.

Bart Simpson: Dammit! (THEN, TO SELF) Okay, don't panic. I can build one of those things from the crap in my desk.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart Simpson, you've had three months to do this project, you started thirty seconds ago.
Bart Simpson: (BOWS) Thank you. Thank you.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm not complimenting you! You've destroyed every ideal I've had about teaching since I saw "To Sir, With Love" as a little girl.
Nelson Muntz: Haw haw, you're old!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I saw it on video in the '80s!
Nelson Muntz: Outdated medium -- I stand by my "haw haw."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (TO NELSON, DISMISSIVE) (MOVING TO DESK) Bart, I'm sending your parents a letter.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (MUTTERS) "Irresponsible..." "unprepared..." "bad seed..."
Bart Simpson: (PROMPTING) Good guy...
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: ...bad guy. Signed... (SHE SIGNS IT) ...stamped...and sealed.
Bart Simpson: (SLY) So, can I deliver that to the office for you?

Bart Simpson: A letter's comin' from school and I need to be home to keep Mom and Dad from getting it.
Bart Simpson: (CALLS OUT) Mommm! I have a fever!

Marge Simpson: Then again, there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading.
Marge Simpson: Bart, pants.

Homer Simpson: What the... you're a month behind on homework?!
Bart Simpson: I tried really hard to stop you from finding out. Does that help?
Homer Simpson: (FURIOUS) A little!
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - day - establishing)
Seymour Skinner: These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey.
Marge Simpson: One month? That's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
Homer Simpson: I say this boy needs more homework.
Homer Simpson: (TO SKINNER) I don't have to do it with him, do I?
Homer Simpson: Pile it on! I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - day)
Homer Simpson: Hm. Clean dishes. (GETTING IDEA) I either have to unload them, or, uh...
Homer Simpson: (SNEAKY CHUCKLE)

Homer Simpson: No problem. You can unload.

PICKACHU-TYPE: (INANE CHATTER)
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?
Homer Simpson: Hey! You're supposed to be doing your homework! No more TV for you!
Homer Simpson: Until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair.
Marge Simpson: (QUIETLY) It's okay, Bart. Just do a couple vocabulary words, then come have some milk and cookies.
Bart Simpson: But Dad said I had to finish--
Marge Simpson: Never mind what he said. You just listen to me.
(Lisa's Bedroom: int. lisa's room - evening)
Bart Simpson: Hey Lis. Mom and Dad just told me two different things. How is that possible?
Lisa Simpson: Well, sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about. In politics it's called a "wedge issue" -- like illegal immigration or gay marriage.
Bart Simpson: Wait a minute. Can I play them against each other so I don't have to do any homework at all?
Lisa Simpson: (APPALLED) You would mess up Mom and Dad's marriage just to get out of doing some homework?
Bart Simpson: Hey, hey, I would end all life on this planet just to get out of doing fractions.
Lisa Simpson: Fractions aren't that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. For example: one half plus one third equals...
Bart Simpson: (CUTTING HER OFF) End. All. Life. On. This. Planet. (EXPLOSION NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING AFTER HIM) You'll need to know fractions to make that explosion!

Bart Simpson: Smooth move, Mom -- tricking Dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer.
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) What the?! Then I wanna eat at (POINTS) Moe's Express!
Moe Szyslak: By "express" I mean you express your anger and hatred.
Marge Simpson: The last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
Homer Simpson: That was last week, and you're still bringing it up!
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) Well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!
Homer Simpson: Well how could I ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
Marge Simpson: You practiced all day on my birthday!
Homer Simpson: Fine. I was gonna apologize, but now I'm not going to!
Marge Simpson: You were never going to apologize!
Homer Simpson: I was too! The words were in my brain!
Marge Simpson: You're wrong! And whenever you're wrong you just sprout gibberish.
Homer Simpson: (GIBBERISH SPOKEN WITH GREAT CONVICTION)

Maude Flanders: Neddy, when you're drying your hands with our monogrammed towels, can you use the "NF" towel, not the "MF"?

Bart Simpson: Dad, I know you're gonna say no, but Mom would say...
Homer Simpson: Whatever. Knock yourself out.
Bart Simpson: What do you mean?
Homer Simpson: You may not realize this, Bart, but your mother and I have been fighting about you a lot lately. And I've realized our marriage is more important than your future. From now on, you're on your own.

Nikki McKenna: Awesome picture.
Bart Simpson: Can I draw a robot barfing screws on your arm with my Sharpie?

Marge Simpson: Homer?
Marge Simpson: I thought you were fixing my brakes!
Homer Simpson: (SEVERAL QUICK PANICKED SCREAMS)

Bart Simpson: He did?
Grampa Simpson: Give up the goods, you yellow devil!
(Airplane: int. airplane - continuous)
Bart Simpson: So I kinda like this girl at school but I'm not sure if she likes me back.
Grampa Simpson: There's one sure way to find out if a girl likes you -- steal a kiss!

Grampa Simpson: Sure did! I remember it like it was yesterday...
Grampa Simpson: Uh-oh.

Nikki's Dad: (GRIM) On the top of the slide.
Homer Simpson: (HAPPY) That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
Homer Simpson: (DELIGHTED LAUGH) I could kiss you.
Nikki's Mom: Mr. Simpson, I'm an attorney, and my husband is a federal prosecutor, and neither of us is happy.
Homer Simpson: Well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.
Nikki's Mom: Unless you make this an affection-free environment, we will sue this school for its last dime.
Seymour Skinner: (HANDS HER DIME) All right, here it is.
Nikki's Mom: (TO HOMER) And we will make you regret the day your son was born.
Homer Simpson: You're halfway home, lady.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)
Bart Simpson: It's not my fault -- Grampa told me to kiss her!
Marge Simpson: (TO GRAMPA, ANNOYED) Why didn't you just tell him to club her on the head and drag her into a cave?
Grampa Simpson: You mean second base? Whoa, he's a little young for that.
Bart Simpson: If I talk to Nikki, I'm sure I can--
Homer Simpson: No! If you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever.

Lisa Simpson: Somebody posted a comment?
Lisa Simpson: (READING) "Don't stop achieving just yet, Lisa. You are not alone -- Flotus-one." (PUZZLED NOISE) "Flotus-one?" Who could that be?
Seymour Skinner: Attention all students. Please report to an attorney-mandated school assembly. To make time for this, the third grade's performance of "My Fair Lady" is cancelled.

(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elementary - auditorium - day)
Gary Chalmers: By now you've probably heard that one of our fourth graders did something that a hundred years ago would've been considered innocent, but in today's overly-litigious society has been blown completely out of proportion.
Nelson Muntz: Now, what he said was...
Kevin: I can hear.
Gary Chalmers: The following skit, or "sketch," demonstrates the behavior we wish you would save for middle school. Annnd action!
Groundskeeper Willie: Oh, I'm just a wee little lass, combin' me beautiful hair. (SINGING) COMB, COMB, COMB-ERY DOO...
Seymour Skinner: (UNCOMFORTABLE) I'm Bart Simpson. Disruptive fourth-grader.
Homer Simpson: (DELIGHTED NOISE) I finally caught one of Bart's school plays.

Groundskeeper Willie: (THINKS SHE MEANS HIM) I sure am!
Michelle Obama: This young lady...
Groundskeeper Willie: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh.
Nikki McKenna: That is the most amazing thing that's ever happened to this school.
Michelle Obama: ...thinks just because she's a high achiever, no one will ever like her. Well, as I tell school children all over the world, I was a high achiever. I got "A"s back when "A"s were hard to get. I was just like Lisa Simpson.
Michelle Obama: That's right, Lisa. As an avid organic gardener, I've read your blog.
Lisa Simpson: (FIGURING IT OUT) "Flotus1" is "First Lady Of The United States... one!"
Michelle Obama: Yes. I wanted just "Flotus," but someone had it.
Ralph Wiggum: That's me, 'cause I swim with my flotuses on!
Michelle Obama: Everything I have I got through academics. I went to Chicago's first magnet high school, then Princeton, then Harvard Law.
Lisa Simpson: And now you're the most elegant and popular woman in the world!
Michelle Obama: Well, I don't know about that... there's Carla Bruni... Queen Noor of Jordan...
Nelson Muntz: They're nothing compared to you!
Michelle Obama: It's not a contest. But if it were, I think we know how it would go. But before I was who I am today, I was a nerd.
Seymour Skinner: So the lesson is, children...
Michelle Obama: I'll tell them what the lesson is.
Gary Chalmers: He's our Joe Biden.
Michelle Obama: Understood. So kids, be nice to Lisa, because the over-achievers will some day be running the country and you don't want them to be too screwed up. (ENCOURAGING) Now, who else is an overachiever? Come on now!
Martin Prince: I am.
COOL SECOND GRADER #1: I am too.

Marge Simpson: But it says here in the brochure...
Jakob: Brochure? Brochure? Brochure? Who wrote your brochure? The same schmuck who wrote The New Testament? I can't talk to you. You talk to my niece, Doreet.
Jakob: Doreet, talk to the stupids.
DOREET: Shalom, goyem!

Ned Flanders: Homer, this is the most sacred spot in Christendom, not your backyard hammock.
Homer Simpson: (SINCERELY APOLOGETIC) I'm sorry. It's just that these tours are so exhausting. You're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing Marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior...

Homer Simpson: Water!
Homer Simpson: (RASPY) So salty... (DRINKS, THEN SAYS EVEN RASPIER) Maybe if I... add a little salt...
Homer Simpson: (INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL SOBS)
Cucumber: (KINDLY) You have been chosen, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (AWESTRUCK AND FEARFUL) Chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?
Cucumber: Rise and listen, my child...yours is a great destiny.
Homer Simpson: (RAPIDLY) Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato. Pickle, carrot, tomato.
Marge Simpson: Oh Homie, you're alive!
Homer Simpson: I am more than alive, woman! I am the Chosen One who shall unite all the faiths of the Holy Land! I am... the messiah!
Marge Simpson: But you still have our passports, right?
Homer Simpson: (NORMAL) Oh yeah. Gotta keep track of those.
Homer Simpson: (BOOMING) The messiah! (NORMAL, TO MARGE) Has the passports.

Lisa Simpson: Dad, are you okay?
Homer Simpson: I'm more than okay! I am the Messiah, come to save the world! Look upon me and shudder!
Bart Simpson: I already do that.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (UNEASY) Uh... Messiah... do you mind if I have a word with your wife?
Homer Simpson: As you wish, but look not upon her with lust. And do not send her friendly emails. That's how it begins.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Homer is suffering from what's called "Jerusalem Syndrome."
Lisa Simpson: Ah yes, "Jerusalem Syndrome." The name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit Jerusalem.
Bart Simpson: Have you ever noticed that Dad always gets the disease they write about in the in-flight magazine?
Marge Simpson: Oh my God, Homer's gone!
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED MURMUR) What's he gonna do now?
Lisa Simpson: (THINKS) Hmm... Dad said he was going to "unite all faiths." (SNAPS FINGERS) And only one site is sacred to Muslims, Christians and Jews -- The Dome of the Rock!
Homer Simpson: The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!
Homer Simpson: (GASP OF DISCOVERY) This one says "Carolina Panthers!"
Homer Simpson: Messiah says (PANTHER NOISE)!
Jakob: Okay, okay, everybody come on. This shrine contains the rock on which Abraham was going to sacrifice his son. And Muslims believe something too. To find out, hire a Muslim tour guide. That's a barrel of laughs. Anyway, shut your face.
Marge Simpson: Thanks, but you can stop giving the tour now.
Jakob: You don't want to do a photo with me? You can hold my gun.
Jakob: I used it in Entebbe. I killed three Ugandans.
Marge Simpson: No thanks.
Jakob: Before you go in, you fill out comment card.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Okay.
Jakob: Eh, eh, don't forget the back.
Marge Simpson: You people are so pushy.
Jakob: What? Israeli people are pushy? How about you experience a couple of genocides and see how laid-back you are? We were purged from Spain. Throw out of there. They allow everybody in Spain, but for us, Jews, no flamenco, get out.
Jakob: I'm pushy?! Please. You stay there surrounded by your great enemy, Canada. Try Syria for two months, then we'll see who's pushy.
Homer Simpson: Attention Christians, Muslims, and Jews. I have come to gather you into a new faith. From now on you shall be called Chrismujews.
Pilgrims: (UNINTERESTED MUTTERS)
Homer Simpson: Because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? They tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. But we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other.
Ned Flanders: (INCREDIBLY TOUCHED) I did it! I reached him!
Homer Simpson: Celebrate your commonality. Some of us don't eat pork. Some of us don't eat shellfish. But all of us love chicken!
Crowd: (AGREEING MURMURS)
Muslim Man: You can simmer it in a ("TA-JEAN") tagine.
Jewish Man: In a soup you can boil it!
Homer Simpson: Spread the word! Peace and chicken!
Crowd: (REVERENTIAL) Peace and chicken!
Agnes Skinner: Don't listen to this fat idiot.

Bart Simpson: (STRIKES A FIGHTING POSE) You can't hurt what's already dead.
Bart Simpson: (IN AGONY) I guess you can.
Ned Flanders: Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth.
Homer Simpson: Well, if I made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in.
Homer Simpson: Can I buy you a twelve dollar turkey sandwich?
Ned Flanders: I'd like that.
Homer Simpson: How 'bout a Greg Norman Executive Putter from the Sky Mall?
Ned Flanders: You'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
Homer Simpson: (STUNNED) They have malls on land?
(Plane: Ext. plane - day - continuous)
Jakob: One at a time! Having your people being thrown out of Spain! Spain! No tapas! I love eating tapas! I love the tiny portions! You don't get too full, but you have a whole variety of flavors! Not for me! Every day who wants a pickle?! Occasionally once a week a little bit of falafel!

C. Montgomery Burns: What caused this puzzling turn of events?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, I'll tell you my tale... by thinking about it to myself.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: ext. nuclear plant - day - establishing)
C. Montgomery Burns: ...and so our Employee of the Month is the late Roger Ducette, who tragically died from complications due to union organizing. (UPBEAT) Moving on. The Power Plant's first annual Fourth of July picnic is this coming Saturday!
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo!
C. Montgomery Burns: (FAKE SINCERE) Ooh, I'm afraid you misunderstand. This picnic is for me. You will all be spending your Independence Day slaving away in the hot summer sun without pay, lotion or gratitude.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, (OVERLY PRONOUNCING IT) duh-ohhh, indeed.

Lenny Leonard: Sir, your spare ribs -- cooked just the way you like 'em.
C. Montgomery Burns: Spare ribs, eh? I've played a round of tenpins or two in my life, and to me, the word "spare" reeks of second best. Give me ten full frames of strike ribs!
C. Montgomery Burns: And you, find my doctor and ask him why I'd ask for something as insane as strike ribs!
Carl Carlson: (WEARY) Yes, sir.
Waylon Smithers: You know, Sir... these people have been working since your six a.m. parade of the flags. Maybe you could give them the rest of the day off to spend with their families.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes. They should go. Just as soon as they perform this musical I've written in celebration of our nation's birth.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CALLING OUT) Grab your scripts, people! We open in twenty minutes! Break a leg!
C. Montgomery Burns: (MENACING) I said break a leg!

Lenny Leonard: I don't know... technically, this is trespassing.
Carl Carlson: (SCOFFS) What's the worst thing he could do?
(Burns's Wine Cellar: int. mr. Burns' wine cellar - a little later)
Carl Carlson: Hey Lenny, ya care for some (FLUENT) Chateau La Mondotte Saint-Emilion?
Lenny Leonard: That's a regular-sized bottle. I'm drinkin' Jeroboams.
Homer Simpson: I'm pounding Melchizedeks!
Carl Carlson: Homer, that's a sixty thousand dollar bottle!
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! I'm drinking my salary!
Lenny Leonard: Yeah, but don't some of that go to income tax?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, you're right.
Homer Simpson: (SHAKES HEAD, THEN BITTER) The government. Taking my hard-earned stolen wine and spending it on that no-good floor.

Lou: Whoa, wait a minute, Chief. This is "The Concert" by Vermeer!
Lou: (EXPLAINING) Which was stolen in 1990 from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum!
Chief Wiggum: So Burns, do you want to explain how this miracle of measure and harmony got into your collection?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, I... you see... it's just (DEFENSIVE) is it a crime to want nice things? And then to steal them from a public museum where any gum-chewing monkey in a Tufts University jacket can gawk at them? (EXTREME FURY) I think not!
Chief Wiggum: (COLDLY) Cuff him, Lou.
(Courthouse: ext. courthouse - day)

Moe Szyslak: Throwin' stuff! Get yer throwin' stuff! Turn a protest into a riot!
Milhouse Van Houten: How much for a tomato?
Moe Szyslak: Fresh is a dollar, rotten's two bucks.
Kirk Van Houten: Son, do you really need the rotten? I mean, it's not like you're actually gonna hit him.
Kirk Van Houten: (BEAT) Awww... since it's your birthday...
Bart Simpson: Mom! I'm gonna go hurl rotten fruit!
Marge Simpson: (COMING OUT DOOR) No one in this family is hurling rotten anything at anyone!

Marge Simpson: Really? Okay, eat your lunch.
Homer Simpson: But--
Marge Simpson: You said it's your lunch. Eat it.
Homer Simpson: Eat my lunch?
Marge Simpson: Yes! Enjoy!

Marge Simpson: I don't see any chewing!
Homer Simpson: (BACKED INTO IT) Okay.
Marge Simpson: Not air bites, real bites.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)

Marge Simpson: Shopping. Every time this town riots, the malls are deserted. You stay here.
Bart Simpson: (MOANS) I hate being stuck at home!
Marge Simpson: (GETS IN CAR) Play with Lisa.
Bart Simpson: Mom, you don't play with Lisa. You play despite her.
Bart Simpson: Bart, I'm not thrilled either. But one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so we'd better keep the lines of communication open. (CHIPPER) Want to help me with my ant farm?
Bart Simpson: You plant the ants and then they grow?
Lisa Simpson: (ROLLS EYES) No, the ants are the farmers.
Bart Simpson: Really? What are they growing?
Lisa Simpson: Nothing! Look, do you want to do it or not?
Bart Simpson: No!
Lisa Simpson: Fine.
(Springfield Penitentiary: Ext. Springfield penitentiary - front gates - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: So ironic. After all my years of stock jobbing, gun running, attempted murder, successful murder, and tom peepery, they get me on a petty multi-million dollar art theft.
Waylon Smithers: (CHOKED-UP) It's so unfair!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, until I am released, you shall be running the nuclear plant.
Waylon Smithers: Me?
C. Montgomery Burns: Be strong, Smithers. Be strong for the plant. She needs you.
C. Montgomery Burns: This would've been a perfect time for it to start raining. Oh what the hell -- I'm telling this story!
C. Montgomery Burns: Not dramatic enough.
C. Montgomery Burns: Frostbite took his nose!
Waylon Smithers: (CONCERNED NOISE)
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.
C. Montgomery Burns: That prison was like a prison to me. Not a prison of bricks and iron, but one of steel and cement. They took everything from me.
Prison Guard: One movie stub from "Tillie's Punctured Romance"... (MILD SURPRISE) envelope marked "bribe"...
Prison Guard: (POINTEDLY) ...empty... social security card...
C. Montgomery Burns: (CORRECTING ANGRILY) That's just an S.S. card, you Dummkopf!
C. Montgomery Burns: My only hope lay in befriending the warden.
(Springfield Prison: int. prison - warden's office - continuous)
Warden: (SOUTHERN ACCENT) Now you looky here, Burns. All your money and influence don't mean nothin' on the inside.
C. Montgomery Burns: (HOLDING TRUMP CARD) Yes... but a wealthy man can buy information, information that can be highly damaging to a certain warden.
Warden: (WORRIED) Well, uh, what information we talkin' 'bout?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well I'm sure the boys at the city desk would be interested to learn that you're addicted to... to...
C. Montgomery Burns: (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Can't read my own writing. (OMINOUS) But I'll tell you this, warden, it starts with an "H"...
Guard: (LOOKING AT NOTE) Ham?
C. Montgomery Burns: It's clearly more than three letters!
Warden: (TO GUARD) Get him out of my sight.
Warden: (NORMAL GRUFF VOICE) Ain't nobody gonna take my "H" from me.
Warden: (HELIUM VOICE) Damn, that gas is noble.
Prison Guard: Time for a cavity search.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) I haven't had a cavity in over forty years.
Prison Guard: I wasn't talking about your teeth.
C. Montgomery Burns: Nor was I.
Prison Guard: Meet your roommate.
Pleasant Cellmate: Hiya, pal! They put two harmless white collar criminals in the same cell. What luck, huh?
C. Montgomery Burns: (RELIEVED CHUCKLE) I was afraid you'd be some tattooed bruiser.
Pleasant Cellmate: Well, they don't turn out too many of those at Dartmouth.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRY) Dartmouth?! (TO GUARD) Get me away from this hideous brute at once!
C. Montgomery Burns: At once! Do you hear me?!
Pleasant Cellmate: Got my Masters from the University of Virginia -- the public Ivy!
C. Montgomery Burns: Guard!

Lisa Simpson: (ANNOYED) Bart! That Pop Tart wasn't locally farmed or sourced!
C. Montgomery Burns: You don't have a "whisper" voice, do you?
Bart Simpson: Oh Lisa, you take the fun out of everything! I am so glad I am not your kid.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I'm so glad I'm not your mom.
Bart Simpson: You should be. If I was in your tummy, I'd poo in your throat.
Lisa Simpson: Ew! Ew! Ew! I'll never get that image out of my head!
Bart Simpson: Oh no. You are not taking the children.

C. Montgomery Burns: Why can't you reject your guy?
Delroy: Because when I was at my lowest, facing fifty years to life...
Delroy: Someone handed me a book...
Delroy: I couldn't read a lick, but that picture of Jesus gave me a comfort I'd never known.
Delroy: So I promised the Lord I'd put that fifty years to use reclaiming lost souls like you!
Delroy: Come to Jesus!

Bart Simpson: Oh my God, that is so sad.
Lisa Simpson: It's the natural order of things. I'm afraid she's got another two, maybe three days, tops.
Bart Simpson: Do we let her spend the rest of her life in the wild? Or let her die in captivity, like Grampa?

Moe Szyslak: Hey, if wishes were horses I'd be eatin' wish-meat every night.
Lenny Leonard: What does that mean?
Moe Szyslak: It means it's not like you're gonna break into the prison and bust him out or anything.
Moe Szyslak: Aw hey, c'mon. You can't really be serious about breaking him out.
Lenny Leonard: It's too late to turn back, Moe. We've exchanged meaningful looks.

Delroy: Do you really want to leave with these idiots?
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm afraid so.
Delroy: But I cleansed you of your evil!
C. Montgomery Burns: I had a little left between my toes. It quickly multiplied, and now I'm a bigger bastard than ever. (KINDLY) But I must know -- what was it about me that made you try?
Delroy: (KINDLY) Because I've killed so many rich white men, I thought I'd do right by at least one.

Chief Wiggum: Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: cops don't have many friends. Civilians are scared of us, and uh, other cops just remind us of things we want to forget. That's why our friendship is so special to me.
Homer Simpson: Chief... (SNIFFS) me too.

Female Activist: Did you know that over forty million sharks are slaughtered every year to make shark-fin soup?
Homer Simpson: (FLUMMOXED) You like sharks?
Male Activist: Being a true eco-activist means supporting every animal's struggle for life.
Female Activist: Except for cockroaches... yuck!
Male Activist: Linda, please.
Homer Simpson: (SCOFFS, THEN SNEERING) Typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, no!
Lisa Simpson: They're right. If the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, I can't let you do it.
Homer Simpson: Sharks, innocent? Please. Every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. The shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder...

Nelson Muntz: Haw haw! You're a spaz!
Lisa Simpson: (RISING) That's not true! First of all, Milhouse fell because you tripped him. Secondly, "spaz" is short for "spastic diplegic," someone who suffers from a serious medical condition. Thirdly, your "haw haw," through overuse, has lost its power.
Nelson Muntz: (GENUINE) Wow. I bow before your logic.

Lisa Simpson: Initially yes, but--
Megan: And isn't most electricity in the United States ultimately derived from the burning of coal?

(Springfield Town Hall: Ext. town hall - day - establishing)

Homer Simpson: Son, I'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and I can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything.
Lisa Simpson: Dad! That's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.

Moe Szyslak: Perhaps I should've told you in person. But there's no easy way to say goodbye forever. So I'll say it the hardest way I can: in Mandarin Chinese. Zai jian yong yuan!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (SHOCKED NOISE)
Moe Szyslak: And now, as our teakettle starts to toot, I'm gonna take a little break. (CLEARS THROAT) Boy, this voiceover thing is killin' me. Whatever that Don Pardo gets paid, it ain't enough.

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now, we don't know for sure it's your wife.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (TO APU) It could be yours!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh, no sir. My marriage is solid. Manjula would never cheat on me like I cheated on-- (REALIZING) Hoo-boy.

Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh, I can't believe I married you. What my grandfather saw in your grandfather, I will never know.
Moe Szyslak: Uh, hey 'Pu. I just want you to know that I got one of your kids here. This ain't a kidnapping thing, but if you're in the mood to give me a million dollars, that's cool. This should not be interpreted by federal agents as a threat. Once again, no threat, but will take the dough.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Well, one of us has to go back to Moe's... maybe have a beer or two... shoot a game of pool, and if I win I have to play the challenger, such are the customs of billiards...
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon: (CALLING AFTER) What a great father, I say sarcastically!

Parson: (CONCERNED NOISE) I'm gonna let you in on a little trick they taught us in Divinity School. Now take a look at Helen over there. She seems happy as a clam, am I right?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (AGREEING) Happier. Where a clam only has one pearl, she has many.

Moe Szyslak: When I saw how much trouble your marriages were in...
Moe Szyslak: I knew I had to act fast.
Moe Szyslak: I got Marge's mother to go to Marge, convinced Helen to ride the rails of romance with the padre, then I bought some roadside corn, ate it raw, got a kernel in my teeth, flossed with the corn silk, and then I came over to fix things with Manjula.
Moe Szyslak: And I wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. Think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. And even she left me. Should not have used helium.
Homer Simpson: Moe, I don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so I'm gonna do both.

THE REAL WALT: You see, I was Bob's cellmate...
(Car: INT. car - driving out OF SPRINGFIELD - DAY)
THE REAL BOB: ...My new cellmate, Walt Warren, was the perfect candidate for my plan. He had the same build as me -- lacking only my regal bearing and leonine grace...

(TWO-MAN CELL: int. two-man cell - evening)
THE REAL WALT: (FRIENDLY) Say, Bob, why do you keep measuring my face?
THE REAL BOB: Just passing the time, bunky.
THE REAL WALT: Well, I guess it beats what the last guy did. Well, nighty-night.
THE REAL BOB: (SINISTER) And nighty-night to you.
(HOSPITAL MEDICAL WARD: int. hospital medical ward - night)
THE REAL BOB: I began by removing Walt's face.
THE REAL BOB: Five-second rule!
THE REAL BOB: That was the easy part. The hard part was removing my own face.
THE REAL BOB: Luckily, as Krusty's sidekick, I'd been hit with so many pies that my face had lost all sensation.

(Car: INT. car - DAY (end of flashback))
THE REAL BOB: I bought the house next to you, and here we are. So I just have to kill you, then sell the house. Selling the house will be murder.

Marge Simpson: Walt, why didn't you tell your story to the guards?
THE REAL WALT: Well, I tried to -- but I had trouble moving my new lips. They heard me babbling, thought I was crazy, and threw me into a padded cell.
(PADDED CELL: int. padded cell - day (flashback))
THE REAL WALT: I tried to warn you by writing "Bart Simpson will die" on the walls, but you ignored me.
(WALT'S HOUSE: Int. Walt's house - day (end flashback))
Marge Simpson: You have to admit, "Bart Simpson Will Die" was kind of open to interpretation.
THE REAL WALT: (SHRUGS) I'm not a writer.

Homer Simpson: Man, that dude does not like Bart.

THE REAL BOB: (IN PAIN) My face! My beautiful borrowed face!
(Gas & Grub: EXT. "gas and grub" - continuous)

Homer Simpson: Mexico! Andalé! Andalé! Arriba!
THE REAL WALT: I don't believe her -- I think she fell in love with my face and she's trying to throw us off the scent.
Marge Simpson: (TRYING TO BE GENTLE) Walt, it's a nice face, but I don't think it would drive a professional waitress to lie.
THE REAL WALT: Well, fine. You go to Mexico. I'm going to Five Corners.
Joyce: Hey, handsome. Is that a loose thread on your collar?
Joyce: (SADLY) All the good men are either gay or have no face.
(REMOTE WILDERNESS: EXT. remote wilderness - DAY)
THE REAL BOB: Welcome to Five Corners -- the only geographic location in the U.S. where five states meet, and where you will meet your doom.
Bart Simpson: (CAJOLING) Come on, Bob, you don't need to kill me. I'll probably kill myself pretty soon with all the stupid things I do. Oh no, I swallowed my tongue. (FAKES TONGUE-SWALLOWING NOISES)
THE REAL BOB: Yes... I would be a fool. Unless I did it here, where your murder will be unprosecutable.
Bart Simpson: You know, the great ones can kill without explaining.
THE REAL BOB: (POINTING TO "STATES") I can stand in one state...fire a gun in a second state, the bullet will travel through the third, hitting you in the fourth, so you fall dead in the fifth.
THE REAL BOB: No single act is against any law. But their sum total is the greatest murder since Snape killed Dumbledore!
Bart Simpson: (MOANS) I haven't gotten to that part yet!
THE REAL BOB: It's a four-year-old book!
Bart Simpson: I'm a slow reader!
THE REAL BOB: A fitting epitaph. (OFF BART'S IGNORANCE) That means last words.
Bart Simpson: Are you here to teach me or to kill me?
THE REAL BOB: What in the name of Malcolm Muggeridge are you doing?
Bart Simpson: Ruining your plan -- if you shoot me while we're in the same state, you go to jail.
THE REAL BOB: (FRUSTRATED) Fine -- I'll just shoot you, and tell people I did the plan.
THE REAL WALT: Not today, Bob!
THE REAL BOB: (UNHAPPY MUTTER)

Chief Wiggum: I don't want to censor myself, that's how creativity dies.
THE REAL BOB: (FRUSTRATED) Blasted Wiggum! How did you find us?
Chief Wiggum: Y'see, Bob, Bart was never convinced you were Walt.
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's bedroom)

Drederick Tatum: How ya doin'? I need a diaper for my chimp, that won't upset my tiger's stomach if he eats the chimp.

Drederick Tatum: Mmm! It's a great time to be a tiger.
Lisa Simpson: (GASP) Mr. Flanders, how did you make these amazing fish?

Simon Cowell: (QUICK) That's not my home number. That's my assistant's work number. (THEN GENIAL) Now Moe, I want to give you a friendly warning -- don't do what I did. Don't become the mean judge.
Moe Szyslak: But it's brought you everything a man could want -- I bet you throw out your paper plates instead of reusing 'em till the food drops through.
Simon Cowell: That's true. Everything you said is true. But there's a cost. I'm lonely, Moe. No one dares be my friend, for fear I'll say something nasty.
Moe Szyslak: But what we do is just kiddin' around, right? People know that.

Simon: This is it, Moe -- America's gonna learn just what sort of man you are.
Ryan Seacrest: Okay Randy, what'd you think of that performance?
Randy Jackson: A'ight, a'ight -- You know what? I was feelin' that, dog. "Happy" was very cool, right? But "birth" was definitely a little pitchy, but -- I gotta tell you something -- you worked it out on "day," man. And then when you hit that "to you" -- dude, that was the bomb! You blew out all the candles, baby!
Ryan Seacrest: If you think that answer was a yes, text the number at the bottom of the screen. Giant secret charges may apply. (TURNS TO KARA) Kara?
Kara DioGuardi: (TO CONTESTANT) I have to admit, I didn't think you could come back from last week, when your version of "Brown Sugar" made Mick Jagger retire from singing forever. But you rocked it!
Ryan Seacrest: Ellen, what's your "ramble" on this?
Ellen DeGeneres: Ryan, I don't ramble anymore. Although I do love that song "Ramblin' Man" by the Allman Brothers. I used to think that they were the "Almond Brothers," which was cool, because I love nuts. Except for filberts, which is weird because I love Dilbert -- 'cause when you're stuck workin' in a cubicle, sometimes you just gotta dance!

Moe Szyslak: I'm gettin' a little emotional here, because your voice, it opened up a little part of me that I thought was closed to truth and beauty forever. If there's a God, I just hope that right now he's votin' your name on that 8-8-8 line. (BREAKING DOWN) It was, it was really beautiful. Really. Thank you. (SOBS)
Ryan Seacrest: Okay, that's four thumbs-up. And finally, because this show now has more judges than the Supreme court... Simon, what do you say?
Simon Cowell: Well, that was truly a remarkable version of "Happy Birthday." Because when it was done, I actually felt like I had lost a year of my life.
Crowd: (LAUGHS, BOOS)
Simon Cowell: But even more objectionable were Moe's insipid comments -- a desperate plea for affection, which fell as flat as the hair on my head.
Crowd: (HOOTS AND LAUGHS)
Moe Szyslak: (SOTTO TO SIMON) Why are you raggin' on me? I'm doin' just what you said.
Simon Cowell: (SOTTO TO MOE) Hmm... let me think, why would I try to sabotage a new judge who just might do what I do for forty-eight million dollars less?
Moe Szyslak: (STANDS, FURIOUS) Hey, hey, hey! I've been double-crossed here! You're pretty smart huh, Simon?! Let's see how smart you are with your voice box hangin' out!

Homer Simpson: You know what, honey? Just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town.
(FANCY NIGHTCLUB: Ext. fancy nightclub - that evening)
Maitre D'ess: (DISMISSIVE SIGH) Right this way.
Marge Simpson: Well at least it's a good place to see celebrities.
Krusty the Clown: (WIPES OFF POWDER) It's not what you think. I'm researching a movie where I play myself.
Maitre D'ess: Wait a minute -- is that bag Marc Fredericks?
Maitre D'ess: You know, a much nicer table just opened up!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) After Bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made.
Chief Wiggum: (TO SARAH) I'm gonna go uh, study the menu.

Goat: (WISE, INDIAN MAN WITH BRITISH ACCENT) I am just a goat, but even I know that a peasant in an emerging economy can't get a break. She needs a microloan.
Goat: A guilty first-worlder lends fifty dollars or more to the Microloan Bank, who uses it to help my owner finance her business.
Goat: (HAPPY) Working together, we can help people help themselves! And now, apparently I am a girl.

Chief Wiggum: (INTO RADIO) I need backup, Lou.
Chief Wiggum: (FILTERED THROUGH RADIO) Get two plates and follow me.
Lou: Chief, not now, I'm undercover.
Chief Wiggum: Oh, it's like that, huh? The minute you go undercover, you act like you don't know me. (TO FAT TONY) He'll turn on you too, Fat Tony -- you just wait.
Lou: (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
Marge Simpson: I suppose I should get something to eat.

Lisa Simpson: Well, whoever your mysterious donor is, he, or she, really wants you to succeed.

Marge Simpson: Thank God! I will never do that again.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Marge. Don't you realize what just happened?
Homer Simpson: (A LITTLE SOTTO) You got to enjoy that bag for nothing! We can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund. (SMALL LAUGH)

Nelson Muntz: (STUNNED) You're L-Simpson-Jazzgirl? Oh my God. I owe you everything.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I didn't do this for thanks, but if you want to thank me, I can stand here and listen for as long as it takes.
DOLPH: (SUGGESTIVE) I'm sure you can.
Nelson Muntz: Lisa, if it weren't for you, I never would have achieved the kind of success... that has allowed me to quit school.
Lisa Simpson: (STUNNED) You're quitting school?!

Seymour Skinner: Seriously? Why? With Nelson gone, lunch money's finally making its way to the cafeteria. Nurples are returning to their natural, non-purple hue. Besides, I hear he's doing quite well with his bicycle pimpery.
Lisa Simpson: (ADMITTING) He is. He's paying people eleven dollars an hour to work for him.
Seymour Skinner: (SITS UPRIGHT) Eleven dollars an hour? That's night watchman money. Maybe I should have a chat with him.
Seymour Skinner: Which of these ties says "confidence?"
Lisa Simpson: (POINTS) Isn't that a Christmas tie?
Seymour Skinner: It's a conversation starter! Lisa, this conversation is over. It's not you I'm trying to impress, it's Nelson. (THOUGHTFUL) I know he likes the sleeveless look...

Cashier: Let me get my supervisor.
Chris Hansen: Hello, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (QUICK SCREAM) How do you know my name?
Chris Hansen: I'm Chris Hansen from "To Catch A Credit-Whore". We know you've been returning used items all over town.

Chris Hansen: People like you?
Homer Simpson: Yes! I mean no! I mean... (TERRIFIED NOISE) You'll never get me!

Lisa Simpson: Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm Lisa, and this is Nelson.
Nelson Muntz: S'up, Zuck?
Nelson Muntz: Fine. Here's exactly what you paid me.
Mark Zuckerberg: "Mark Zuckerberg is... (TYPES INTO COMPUTER) happy to meet new friends."
Lisa Simpson: That's great, Mr. Zuckerberg, but I was hoping you could tell us how education was instrumental to your success.
Mark Zuckerberg: Well, the truth is... I dropped out of Harvard.
Lisa Simpson: (STARTLED) You did?
Nelson Muntz: Better earnin' than learnin'!
Mark Zuckerberg: (NODS) Hell yeah! I'll get the best kind of degree... (HIP-HOP) honorary, baby!

Marge Simpson: Well, I learned a valuable lesson about wanting more than I could afford.
Grampa Simpson: Marge, you couldn't have fun if you were a monkey on a banana boat!
Lisa Simpson: I used Grampa's money to try to help someone in need. But it didn't go the way I expected.
Grampa Simpson: Aw sweetie, money can't change people. It can just help them be who they are. I gave a bum a dollar once and he used it to buy an Ellery Queen mystery. But there was one mystery Ellery Queen couldn't solve: why a man was named Ellery. But my point is, whatever I said before I started talking about Ellery Queen.

Dewey Largo: Never-you-mind what kind! Fix my bike!
Ralph Wiggum: I want my money back!
Seymour Skinner: (EXAMINING GLUE) This epoxy you've been using is water soluble.

Seymour Skinner: You can't break us up. We're like a family here.
Seymour Skinner: Kearney and I are having brunch on Sunday.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (DISINTERESTED) If I'm up.
Nelson Muntz: (TO SKINNER) Listen, what say we go back to the school? (SELLING) I'll help you out with a little micro-financing of my own.
Seymour Skinner: (TOUCHED) Fifty dollars! I can buy paint for the art class instead of crushed-up berries I find in the woods!
Nelson Muntz: And Lisa, I've got a little left that I'd like to spend on you.

Dahlia: (NODS) I just graduated from Yale, and thought I'd pay a visit -- from Yale -- to the little school where it all began.
Lisa Simpson: (STRIVING CHUCKLE) I plan to attend an Ivy League school myself. (MODESTLY) I do have a 4.0 GPA.
Nelson Muntz: She can do the kind of math that has letters. Watch: what's "x," Lisa?
Lisa Simpson: Well, that depends.
Nelson Muntz: (TO DAHLIA) Sorry, she did it yesterday.
Dahlia: (SMILES) I believe you. What else have you got?
Lisa Simpson: Um, I'm treasurer of the Jazz Club, and started the school's recycling society.
Dahlia: Nice. And?
Lisa Simpson: Uh, that's it.
Dahlia: Two clubs? Well that's a bridge bid, not an Ivy League application.
Lisa Simpson: But I'm only in second grade.
Dahlia: By your age, I'd been the dominant force in dozens of extracurricular activities.
Seymour Skinner: Quite so! Just take a look at her yearbook.

Homer Simpson: (SULLEN) Hello, Flanders. Don't you have a neighbor on the other side?
Ned Flanders: Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!
Ned Flanders: Bart, call me Walter Matthau, 'cause I'm a bad-news bearer. I'm resigning as manager of your Little League team.
Bart Simpson: What? Why?
Ned Flanders: In the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and I let it go without saying a word. (SOMBER) I just don't like the monster I've become. (SIGHS)
Bart Simpson: (SAD SIGH) But without a coach, we can't play!
Marge Simpson: Homie, maybe you could do it.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Marge. The last time I stepped on a baseball field, I got tased.

Nelson Muntz: Those are dudes!
Lisa Simpson: Really?... They sound like... I mean... well, the thing... (EMBARRASSED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: Okay, bottom line: I need an extra-curricular activity, and no one else will coach you loveable losers.
Bart Simpson: We're not losers. Last year we finished six and five.
Nelson Muntz: And we're not loveable. We had a tall freckled-faced kid on the team that we picked on till he quit.
Nelson Muntz: Hey Splatter-face! How's the weather up there?
Nelson Muntz: It's too bad 'cause he's a great hitter, but it's worth it.

Lisa Simpson: Hey, Dad.
Homer Simpson: (TIPSY) Hey pal, howya doin'?
Lisa Simpson: Fine. I was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy.
Moe Szyslak: The only thing I know about strategy is that whatever the manager does, it's wrong, unless it works, in which case he's a button-pusher.
Lenny Leonard: I hate guys that just push buttons all day.
Carl Carlson: You just push buttons all day.
Lenny Leonard: You know, ever since Obama came in, you've got all the answers, don't you?
Lisa Simpson: (FRUSTRATED NOISE) Does anyone here actually know anything about baseball?

Gary: As a pitcher, Cliff Lee is clearly superior to Zack (GRENKY) Grienke.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Uh yes, I completely agree, with the following colossal exception: before the fourth inning after a road loss in a domed stadium. Then it's good to be Grienke. Unless he's got a bunion, in which case he is notably ineffective. (FRINK NOISE)

Doug: The key to understanding the game is sabermetrics.
Lisa Simpson: Huh?
Professor Jonathan Frink: The field was developed by statistician Bill James...
Bill James: I made baseball as fun as doing your taxes!
Professor Jonathan Frink: Using sabermetrics, even an eight-year-old girl can run a ballclub with the sagacity of a Stengel and the single-mindedness of a Steinbrenner. I call it a Stein-stengel-(FRINK NOISE).
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, guys.
Moe Szyslak: (ANNOYED) Hey, speaking of stats, I'm none too pleased about your ratio of "seats occupied" to "beers ordered."

Nelson Muntz: We're no longer cellar dwellers. (EMBARRASSED) Well, the team isn't.
Bart Simpson: This isn't the game I grew up with, the game played in the misty ballparks of Enron Field, or Pac Bell, then S.B.C., now A. T. and T. Park. And from now on, I'm gonna play my game.

Marge Simpson: What about Bart's feelings?
Homer Simpson: Boys don't have feelings, they have muscles.

Bart Simpson: Sorry sis, I've moved on, and my days of listening to my manager are over.

Marge Simpson: (HUGE GASP) Mike Scioscia! Didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the Springfield Nuclear Plant?
Mike Scioscia: I sure did -- and it gave me super-managing powers! (SADLY) I also demagnetize credit cards.
Mike Scioscia: Bart, I have two pieces of advice. First, keep your arms in the damn car.
Mike Scioscia: Secondly, I don't care if your manager is your sister, Dick Drago's mustache, or Oscar Gamble's afro! A player should always listen to his skipper -- that's how I got these three World Series rings.
Mike Scioscia: Never mind that -- I'll win more. But you owe it to your sister, and the great game of baseball-- (SEES CAMERA) wacky face for the camera!
Mike Scioscia: ...to go back and help your team. Now, who wants funnel cake?
Mike Scioscia: (MANAGING) You got some great raw ingredients, kid. Open up your stance a little. (SUDDENLY ANGRY) Wrong, wrong, wrong!

Bart Simpson: (HANGS HEAD) I guess your computer was right.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe it was, but according to my calculations, you're a great brother fifty-one percent of the time.

Seymour Skinner: (HUMS, THEN:) Buying those extra trophies from cash-strapped schools really filled out the old case.
Lisa Simpson: Principal Skinner? Quick question. Is it true my Mom was a great student?
Seymour Skinner: Oh indeed. Your mother was as fine a student as you.
Seymour Skinner: Keep up the good work and you'll probably wind up just like her.
Lisa Simpson: Well... of course that would be great. (WEAK CHUCKLE, THEN DIPLOMATIC) But I see myself making an impact... outside the home.
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLE) Lisa, one of the hardest jobs I have is throwing cold water on young children's dreams.
Seymour Skinner: Ralph, you're not a kangaroo.
Ralph Wiggum: (SAD NOISE)
Seymour Skinner: The point is, I've learned a lot about human nature by sitting in the park with mother. And one thing I've learned is children turn out like their parents. Behold, your future!

Lisa Simpson: (DELICATELY) Well, um, I was looking through Mom's old schoolwork, and I noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you.
Homer Simpson: Hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. Sooner or later, everyone meets their "Homer."
Lisa Simpson: No offense Dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams.
Homer Simpson: It may not be a boy. It could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the Santa Fe lifestyle. Just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die.
Lisa Simpson: No! That's not gonna happen to me! I'm gonna make sure nothing distracts me ever!

Marge Simpson: Lisa, honey, I insist. Because it's important to you that you don't turn out like me.
Lisa Simpson: Mom... I don't want to go to that school.
Marge Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) Why not?
Lisa Simpson: Because, it's too elitist. Everyone's parents are in "the business."
Marge Simpson: What business?
Lisa Simpson: I don't know! They won't tell me! And besides... you were willing to do all this just so I would be happy! Mom, I'd be honored if I turned out like you.

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Well, that is your bad luck because he is mine right now. Come back in half and hour and he can be your accomplice.
Snake Jailbird: (UNDER BREATH) I was going to take him ice skating.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (AMUSED) What was that?

Chief Wiggum: Uh, it's pretty much the same thing.
Lou: Plus we could always dig ourselves out, although that never seems to occur to anybody.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SIGHS) Set 'er down, Smithers.
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, you can't hurt us after all we've done for you.
C. Montgomery Burns: What the devil are you talking about?
Marge Simpson: You were given six weeks to live. And you've outlived it! I think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people.
C. Montgomery Burns: Could it be? Perhaps kindness did keep me alive.
C. Montgomery Burns: Young man, would you like a lemon drop?
C. Montgomery Burns: (SCREAMS OF PAIN)
Ralph Wiggum: (CRIES)
C. Montgomery Burns: It wasn't kindness that was keeping me alive, it was bile building up inside! Loathing is my life blood and rage my royal jelly! So yes, thank you, Springfield, for giving me the secret to eternal life -- hate!
Homer Simpson: (PROUDLY) You're welcome!

Lisa Simpson: (ROLLS EYES) Or, more likely, the phone number of the bird's owner.
Bart Simpson: (HUSHED) Ask about the safe. (CORRECTING) No, better yet, act like you know about the safe.
Man On Phone: (WISEGUY) Hello.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, I believe I have your pigeon, (READING OFF BAND) "Raymond Bird," and I need to know how to return him to you.
Wiseguy: (VERY SARCASTIC) He's a homing pigeon, girlie. Why don't you let him fly home? Unless you wanna spring for a limo.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, he could fly home, except that he has a broken wing. Perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to Springfield and retrieve him.
Wiseguy: Are you kidding? Wherever I go, two hundred birds gotta come with me. And they all want to sit in the front seat with daddy.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Looks like you're gonna have to take care of him, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Me? Just what in my long, sad history with frogs makes you think I can take care of a bird?
Lisa Simpson: (SCARED YELP, SHAKING HEAD) No, no... Listen, don't tell anyone, but... (UPSET) I can't stand pigeons! They're like rats with wings!

Milhouse Van Houten: I thought your race car was a Transformer! Nothing's one thing anymore!

Bart Simpson: No, I was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth.
Homer Simpson: Way ahead of you.

Dr. Thurston: (NODS) So, Marge, what I understand from our phone conversation is, you have a very poor service provider.
Marge Simpson: I bought it because Catherine Zeta Jones told me to. What a fool I was.
Dr. Thurston: Secondly, there's been a major breach of trust between Bart and Santa's Little Helper.
Bart Simpson: Well, he shouldn't kill birds. It's not right!
Dr. Thurston: That is correct... according to human standards. But all a dog can do is follow his animal inclinations, right?

Lisa Simpson: (SHOCKED) You're gonna put him down?

Fat Tony: Nicky, welcome to the family. From now on, you don't know where you end and we begin. Your problems are our problems.
Homer Simpson: My neck is kind of itchy.
Fat Tony: Then all of our necks are itchy.
Legs: Now that you mention it, it's itchy like crazy!
Homer Simpson: (INCREDIBLY TOUCHED NOISE)
(DOCKS: Ext. docks - night)
Fat Tony: Nicky, my friend, tonight is a big score I've been settin' up for months.
Fat Tony: (ON MONITOR) Just you and me -- sharing it together.
Fat Tony: To heterosexual male friendship, the kind the Greeks wrote about.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Fat Tony: Here they are -- my Belgian guns.
(FBI Observation Van: Int. FBI van - continuous)
Fbi Supervisor: Belgian guns. I've been waiting half my life for this moment.
(Dock: Ext. dock - continuous)
Fbi Supervisor: (IN HOMER'S EARPIECE) All units, move in!
Homer Simpson: (DESPERATE) Tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!
Fat Tony: What? Why?
Homer Simpson: Don't ask questions! Just go!
Fat Tony: What's gotten into you? You're as nervous as a cat when Johnny Kick-A-Cat walks into the room.
Fat Tony: (SPEAKS IN FLEMISH:) Verlaat de vuurwapens op het dok En wij kunnen een Chimay bier drinken!
(FBI Observation Van: Int. FBI van - continuous)
Fbi Supervisor: Get a shot of Tony with the guns!
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Ayyyy!

Fbi Supervisor: Too close.
Homer Simpson: Ohhhh!
Fbi Supervisor: Closer.
Homer Simpson: Ayyyy.
Fbi Supervisor: Too close.
Homer Simpson: Ohhhh.
Fbi Supervisor: Perfect.
Fat Tony: Wait a minute...
Fat Tony: How could you, Nicky?! I would have given you everything! In the strip club of my heart, you held the key to the champagne room! (PLAINTIVE) I loved you, man.
Female Agent: He's dead.
Homer Simpson: No! You're wrong! Check again!
Fbi Supervisor: Fuhgetaboutit.
(DOCKS: ext. docks - a while later)
Fbi Supervisor: Homer, I just want to say that of all the rat bastards we've had working for us, you were the snitchiest.
Homer Simpson: So that's it! You used me to kill a man, and all I get is a handshake and a blanket?
Female Agent: We didn't say you could use the blanket.
Fbi Supervisor: And I'm not gonna shake your hand.
Homer Simpson: Poor Tony. He didn't deserve this. He was just a soldier in a war he started.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - master bedroom - later)
Marge Simpson: Homie, I know you had a terrible experience, but it's over.
Homer Simpson: It's not over, Marge. It'll never be over. When I shut my eyes, all I see is Fat Tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach.
Marge Simpson: You never took me to that bar on the beach.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Well, uh... you wouldn't like it. It's not very good.
Marge Simpson: Sounds pretty good.
Homer Simpson: No, no, I oversold it.
(Springfield Cemetery: ext. springfield cemetery - day)
Homer Simpson: I'd give anything to bring you back.
Fit Tony: (OMINOUS) Wake up, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (HORRIFIED GASP) Fat Tony?
Fit Tony: No -- I'm his cousin from San Diego, Fit Tony.
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Wow, I've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising.
Fit Tony: (MENACING) And there's no better exercise than killing and disemboweling a big, fat snitch.
Homer Simpson: I understand. I loved him too. (SOBS)
Fit Tony: Your tears seem in no way crocodilian.
Homer Simpson: (SAD) Do what you gotta do. The quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there.
Fit Tony: Join me on the elliptical machines.
Fit Tony: I will let you live for... (PRESSES BUTTON ON DASHBOARD OF MACHINE) twenty minutes.
(Gym: int. gym - a little later)
Homer Simpson: I worked for Fat Tony. And he was the best boss I ever had.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well. This is awkward.
Homer Simpson: Wha-- oh, oh, uh, Mr. Burns? Uh, you were cool too.
C. Montgomery Burns: (BITTERLY) Oh, I so believe that.
Milhouse Van Houten: This is gonna be great! A real rumble! Just like in that movie where the Jets fought the Sharks!
Homer Simpson: He took me to a fight that he fixed. But he never let on. Not even when I bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. (CHUCKLES) Then he said he would dope a horse for me.
Fit Tony: (MENACING) Homer, it is time... (THEN PLEASANT) to switch your elliptical machine to cool-down mode.
Homer Simpson: (BREATHING HEAVILY) Are you gonna kill me now? 'Cause I'm super ready.
Fit Tony: No. Because my cousin lives on in your memories. And to extinguish you, would be to whack what still remains of him.
Homer Simpson: (STUNNED) Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?
Fit Tony: It's pretty screwed-up. That's why I keep my friends close.
Homer Simpson: And your enemies closer?
Fit Tony: No! Why would I do that? If they were close, they would kill me!
Homer Simpson: Fit Tony took his cousin's place running the Springfield mob.
Homer Simpson: The pressures got to him so he started to eat. Soon, he was known as "Fit Fat Tony," then just "Fat Tony" for short.
Homer Simpson: And me? Now, I'm just an average shnook like everyone else.
Homer Simpson: Stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. And the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.
Homer Simpson: And I have to admit, it's a pretty good life.
Groundskeeper Willie: Dodgeball!

Lisa Simpson: ('30s-STYLE) Your four eyes saw a lot today, Milhouse. What's the skinny?
Milhouse Van Houten: The fifth graders played a great game. They got a great program up there, great fans, but this was just our day. Whatever happens, they can never take away--
Milhouse Van Houten: (PAINED YELP)
Erik: The ball never touched the ground -- and I caught it!
Groundskeeper Willie: That means... fifth graders win!
4th Graders: (FURIOUS) No way! / What a rip! / Mannn!
Groundskeeper Willie: Shut your gobs! I only took this refereeing job 'cause I was cold and needed a shirt!

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Mike, let's be adults here.

Tough 5th Grader: (BOWERY BOY) They ain't even read "Where The Red Fern Grows" yet!
5th Graders: (CRACK UP)
Bart Simpson: That's it! (IN ERIK'S FACE, GRIM) We challenge you to a rumble.

Bart Simpson: It's agreed -- no biting, no throwing rocks, no face farts, flying face farts, backdoor haircuts, 'nad noogies, moist Michaels, and absolutely no "Brazilian hardwood."
Erik: (SCORNFUL) Is this a rumble or a harvest dance?
Bart Simpson: Okay, you want hardwood?
Erik: (BACKING DOWN) No, no, no, no.
Bart Simpson: Then let's do this thing!
(Skinner's Office: int. principal skinner's office - continuous)
Seymour Skinner: You know, if they do this regularly, maybe it could count as gym.
Gary Chalmers: Did you wear those same clothes yesterday?
Seymour Skinner: (LYING) No, I have two identical sets of these clothes.
Gary Chalmers: I see, with a stain on the shirt in the exact same place?
Seymour Skinner: (SIGHS, SADLY) Things aren't good at home.
(SPRINGFIELD PLAYGROUND: ext. springfield playground - afternoon)
Martin Prince: Rumble!!!!!
Nelson Muntz: Why don't you head on home, pal?
Martin Prince: (RELIEVED) Bless you.
Bart Simpson: (AMAZED) Where'd you get that scar?
Erik: Had it as long as I can remember. Why?
Groundskeeper Willie: (ANGRILY) You call that a scar? This is a scar.
Nelson Muntz: That's your bellybutton. Everybody's got one.
Groundskeeper Willie: (SOBS) I thought I was special!
(Springfield Street: ext. springfield street)
Bart Simpson: When did this happen?
Bart Simpson: You sure none of you guys gave me this?
Kearney Zzyzwicz: I'm going through my bully logbook here, but I just don't see it.

Marge Simpson: Why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
Homer Simpson: Can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling. (HUMS)
Bart Simpson: Mom, do you have any idea how I got this scar?
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) I was afraid this day would come.
Bart Simpson: Ew, you're sitting on the toilet.
Marge Simpson: When it's closed it's a chair! When you were little, I used to take you to a Mommy-and-Me toddler gym.
Marge Simpson: You were friends with three other boys and I became close with their moms.
Marge Simpson: But they were a bad influence on you.
Bart Simpson: (WISTFUL) Ah, such an innocent time. Before cooties ravaged our community. How come we don't get together anymore?
Marge Simpson: The Moms and I had a falling out, which was a shame. (WISTFUL) We had been such good friends.
Bart Simpson: Whoa. You don't look like a mom, you look happy.
Marge Simpson: We called ourselves "the Cool Moms."
Bart Simpson: (SINCERE) There's nothing cooler than calling yourself cool.
Marge Simpson: Maybe we could get back together...
Bart Simpson: Awesome! I'll get the white wine.
Marge Simpson: You can't buy white wine!
Bart Simpson: Why not? Are you having red meat?
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: Are you through with the chair? I've got to do the taxes.
Marge Simpson: It's all yours.
Homer Simpson: (TO SELF) Okay let's see, number of dependents: three. Um, add to line thirteen...
Homer Simpson: Hm, better check last year's return.
Homer Simpson: Hm.
Marge Simpson: (HAPPILY) Seven years. A lot of memories. Talking, chatting...

Rachel: (AGREEING NOISES)
Connie: You know who was really happy to get back together: our husbands.

Marge Simpson: (UNSUCCESSFULLY TRYING TO HIDE TIPSINESS) Just a little Merloooot.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: You wanna stay up and talk a while? I'm not sleepy.
Marge Simpson: And Anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? They went to the beach every day!
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.
Marge Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS) But I don't want a beach house. Sand makes me sad. Because it used to be big rocks. But not anymore. (GETTING SAD) Not anymore...

(The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop: int. android's dungeon - continuous)
Comic Book Guy: (HORRIFIED NOISE) I knew this day would come. Although frankly, I thought it would have been a long time ago. You are very uncurious about your body.
Bart Simpson: All right, Comic Book Guy, tell me my origin story.
Comic Book Guy: I will not relive the horror of that day! The answer is "no," and I can say it in Na'avi or Klingon, which are pretty much the same. I have some theories on that which I will share with you never!
Bart Simpson: You leave me no choice. I hold in my hands a mint-condition copy of the legendary "Interesting Stories Number Twenty-Seven."
Comic Book Guy: Oh! Oh! The first appearance of Radioactive Man!
Bart Simpson: And if you don't tell us what we want to know...
Comic Book Guy: (HORRIFIED NOISES, THEN:) How do I know that is not a cheap reprint?
Bart Simpson: Are you willing to take that chance?
Comic Book Guy: Yes.
Comic Book Guy: No! No! No! (DEFEATED) I'll tell you what you want to know.
Lisa Simpson: Could we hurry this up? I am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store.
Comic Book Guy: Very well. I shall tell you what happened to you and your friends several years ago. But for you to understand it, I must go back a little further.
Comic Book Guy: Our story begins with the creation of Middle Earth, as recounted in the Ainulindalë and Valaquenta...
Comic Book Guy: Behold Melkor, proudest of the Ainu!
Bart Simpson: Look pal, we've gotta speed this up.
Comic Book Guy: (SIGHS) Fine. Children just want to know "what is," and not why it is.
Comic Book Guy: Your scar, like Tom Cruise's last good movie, was born on the Fourth of July.
(Springfield High School: Ext. Springfield high school - establishing shot - dusk)
Comic Book Guy: It was seven years ago... a time when "Twilight" meant the end of day and not the most barftastic horror franchise of all time.
Comic Book Guy: Earth's single sun was setting, and the Mayor began to speak...
Mayor Joe Quimby: Even though most of this town collaborated with the British, and we are still in informal talks to return to their empire, we all love fireworks!
Springfielders: (CHEERS)
Comic Book Guy: Traditionally, the Fourth of July fireworks were operated by the person most likely to be sober and dateless. Once again, the honor fell to me.
Springfielders: (CHEERS)
Brandine Del Roy: This is your TV for the year, kids.
Cletus Spuckler: And the embers is your dinner.
Comic Book Guy: While I was busy tending to a critical matter of great delicacy...you and your diaper-wearing droogs ruined everything!
Comic Book Guy: And that is when the four of you each received the mark of the sword.
Comic Book Guy: Every Fourth of July I remember that fallen hero.
Comic Book Guy: God, how I miss you.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - garage - later)
Milhouse Van Houten: So, what's the plan again?
Lisa Simpson: Hey, does Dad know you and the cool moms broke up?
Bart Simpson: I go to see those other guys, we blow this junk up, once again Mom decides that they're a bad influence on me, and she stops seeing those women who make her so happy.
Marge Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP) What are you boys doing?
Milhouse Van Houten: Uh, we're doing a project on... uhhh... the subject of... something pertaining to... here it comes...
Marge Simpson: Milhouse, I'm getting tired of waiting.
Milhouse Van Houten: Can I go home and think of a lie?
Marge Simpson: Yes, you may.
Bart Simpson: (SWEETLY) Mom, I'll admit it: I wanted to create a devastating explosion to get back my Mom.
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED NOISE) Bart, sweetie...
Marge Simpson: I love you kids with all my heart, but dammit, I need something for myself!
Bart Simpson: I made you a coffee mug on Mother's Day! Isn't that enough?
Marge Simpson: It's close, but no.
Bart Simpson: (SAD) I could light these, but, it wouldn't be the same.
Homer Simpson: Well, I've put it off, but today I'm finally getting this garage organized--
Homer Simpson: (DAZED) Guess I'll put these tools away. Put 'em on hooks and stuff.
(Suburban House: ext. suburban house - night - establishing)
Marge Simpson: So Bart... the little dickens... was gonna set off an explosion to break us up. Can you believe it? (GIGGLES)

Rachel: (GIGGLES AND INTRIGUED NOISES) / C'mere, you.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - morning - establishing)
Lisa Simpson: Sorry you broke up with your friends, Mom.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) I think they were never my friends... Maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a Mommy and Me class. They're random people you meet in a college dorm.
Bart Simpson: Maybe Lisa and I can be friends -- not with each other, but with you.
Marge Simpson: Awww...
Marge Simpson: Well... Homer got along so well with the other dads, I couldn't break it to him.
(Simpson Backyard: ext. simpson back yard - meanwhile)

Fat Late Shift Worker: That's funny, 'cause I found this candy bar in my desk.
Homer Simpson: (GRIM) Time to punch in.

C. Montgomery Burns: Charles Montgomery Plantagenet... Schicklgruber... Burns.
Waylon Smithers: (INTRIGUED) Sir, is that your will?
C. Montgomery Burns: It is. I know it's hard to see a young buck like me and think of a day when I'm no longer in the pink.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: We just need one more set of initials here. Quickly, now, we're almost through the half hour per day where you're mentally competent.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: And... demented.

Waylon Smithers: (VERY ANGRY) Your tortoise?!
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, it always saddens me that you and Sheldon have never gotten along.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, how could you leave me out of your will? I'm your right-hand man, your guy Friday!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, you are the campiest of my aides du camp, but I'm afraid my true admiration is reserved for the self-made man. (SHAKES HEAD) No Steve (DRAWN OUT) Woz-ni-ak thee.
Waylon Smithers: So... you don't respect me?
C. Montgomery Burns: No, not until you earn it. Until then, I will never see you as my equal.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers... wait!
Waylon Smithers: (HOPEFUL) Yes, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: In case you didn't hear me, I said I will never see you as my equal.
Waylon Smithers: I heard you very clearly, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.

Bouncer: In, in, in, (TO SMITHERS, CLOSING ROPE) in your dreams.

(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern - meanwhile)
Waylon Smithers: Can I have a scotch and water?
Moe Szyslak: My scotch is a scotch and water.
Waylon Smithers: Business is slow, huh?
Moe Szyslak: Yeah. Frankly, I'm surprised you're not across the street where they drink for fun, instead of here, where, uh, horrible addiction compels you.
Waylon Smithers: They won't let me in -- no one wants an executive assistant who only works out six hours a day. If only this town had a "men's bar" for the average-looking fellow...
Ms. Juniper: No. But you can say you'll come with us.
Mr. Burns Heads: (FIRST HEAD) ...True admiration... (SECOND HEAD) Self-made man... (THIRD HEAD) kill the other two heads... (FIRST HEAD) true admiration... (SECOND HEAD) self-made man... (THIRD HEAD) kill them before they suspect... (FIRST HEAD) suspect what?...
Waylon Smithers: Huh? Huh? Listen, what if I helped you turn this bar into a hangout for guys like me?
Moe Szyslak: (INTRIGUED) Uh-huh...
Waylon Smithers: Just so it's clear what I'm proposing, the men I'm talking about are...
Moe Szyslak: Whoa, whoa, whoa! No offense, uh, but uh, I just ain't comfortable hanging around all night with, uh, y'know whatchamacallit... uh, swishkabobs.
Waylon Smithers: (KNOWING) Yeah, right. It's too bad. Could have been fun. Could have made a little money.

Carl Carlson: Hey, what's that guy doing in the men's room?
Homer Simpson: (GASP) He's washing his hands.
Lenny Leonard: (AGGRAVATED NOISE) I am never gonna get that image out of my head.
Moe Szyslak: Look, I've turned this bar into every other kind of bar and it never worked.
Moe Szyslak: Total disaster. Complete bomb. Utter failure. Uh, dream I painted. And in this economy a man needs to find new customers while keeping his old best friends. So, whaddaya say?

Dewey Largo: (SOTTO) Honey, just teach the one with the starfish head (POINTS TO LISA) and you'll be okay.
Ms. Juniper: Teach? You can't teach music. You embrace music, oh, you inhale music, you roll around in a pile of music until (INHALES) the scent of music is on you forever!

Moe Szyslak: Why would they think that?
Moe Szyslak: Oh, I love you, Neil Patrick Hairless. (KISSING NOISES)
Moe Szyslak: Huh. Maybe I should clear the air.
Moe Szyslak: Uh, excuse me, fellas. Excuse me. First of all... thank you. This bar was on its last legs. I was gonna have to move in with ma, who's dead and doesn't have a house. So, would not have been good.

Bart Simpson: That wasn't me and you're my alibi.
Seymour Skinner: Yes, well. (CLEARS THROAT) I might have a crush on the music sub, Ms. Juniper.
Seymour Skinner: Leave with you? I'll have to check with mother.
Seymour Skinner: Simpson, here's my plan. (HOLDS FILE) Ms. Juniper is divorced, and her daughter Melody is in the third grade.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah, her. Classic space case.
Seymour Skinner: Well, if you took "space case" on a date... and brought me to chaperone along with her mother...
Bart Simpson: I see how it is. You get a booty call and I get a cootie call. Well, it's gonna cost ya.
Seymour Skinner: (NODS) How would you like two weeks of spring break?
Bart Simpson: Triple spring break plus four weeks at Christmas.

Ms. Juniper: Dance with me.
Seymour Skinner: What? Here? Right next to the Nacho-cano?
Ms. Juniper: I like you, Seymour.
Seymour Skinner: (NERVOUS) You do? But why? (SUAVE, COMPOSED) I mean... but why?
Ms. Juniper: Sh! Words are your enemy, my love. (SEDUCTIVE) Melody is staying at her father's tonight and, well, I can't dance by myself... although I do.

Patty Bouvier: The city won't let us march in the Springfield Founder's Parade.
Moe Szyslak: Well who needs 'em? We can have your own parade.
Julio: We do. We have like twenty of them.
Grady: But we're sick of being second-class citizens! (SHAKES HEAD) Things will never change until one of us is on the town council.
Grizzly Shawn: Moe should run! He's the heart of this town's gay community.
Grady: Will you do it, Moe? Will you become Springfield's first openly-gay City Councilman?
Moe Szyslak: (CHUCKLES) Well, I think if you guys can manage to go into the voting booth one at a time, then I can manage to win!

Moe Szyslak: (CHUCKLES AS IF SMITHERS IS COMING ONTO HIM)

Seymour Skinner: Calliope, is there anything I can say to make you stay?
Agnes Skinner: Seymour! I found a ticket stub for a James Bond movie in your pants! Explain yourself!
Seymour Skinner: Well, it, it, uh... took place in a country we teach about.
Agnes Skinner: Fibs break Jesus' ribs!

Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.
Grady: Oh, Moe! How could you lie about who you are when who we are is all we are?
Moe Szyslak: I didn't mean to. At first, I was only gay for your money. And, and I had real, deep feelings for that money. But then I felt accepted by you in a way that I'd never been before. I just wish you people could know what it's like to want acceptance. Well, so who you gonna vote for? Me? Or a republican whose record is so anti-gay, he's clearly secretly super gay.
Julio: Now we don't know who to vote for, the liar or the denier!
Distinguished Older Gentleman: (PATRICK STEWART VOICE, DRAMATIC) Once again the powers that be have spurned our request for basic human equality. Must not the heavens themselves cry with rage?!

Bart Simpson: What is this crap? Are you wearing a wire?
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Someday you'll understand that I'm just being a good dad.
Bart Simpson: Are you kidding? You're the worst dad who ever lived! I'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
Homer Simpson: Why you little!!!
Patrick: Homer, a good father is strong enough that he doesn't need to use his strength. What Bart needs is for you to strangle him with your love.
Homer Simpson: Hm. I never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.
Homer Simpson: Son, I won't strangle you anymore, but I also won't get you that mini-bike.
Bart Simpson: How 'bout this? I let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile.

Bart Simpson: Does he give you money for getting good grades?
Lisa Simpson: I've been doing the family's books for years. I take what I need.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - TV room - day)

Patrick: Well, as they say in Paris, "Ma voiture est pleine de crème glacée."
Sam: You just said "My car is full of ice cream!"
Bart Simpson: Dad, if I get an "A" on my math test, would that be worth some money?
Homer Simpson: (CONSIDERING) Well, in season two, when Sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward.

Bart Simpson: (FURIOUS) What the? I wanted a mini-bike! I told all my friends I was getting one!
Homer Simpson: Well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends.
Bart Simpson: Yes they were! But now they won't be! Because I don't have a mini-bike!

Homer Simpson: Can't lose that. It's the best picture of me I have.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Well, I am more concerned with global terrorism. America's enemies would give anything for your nuclear knowledge.

Marge Simpson: I've got summer squash!
Homer Simpson: Hmm, the boy's acting really weird. I did everything that TV show told me to and he's still not happy.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old TV show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy.
Homer Simpson: Where is he going?

Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Now all you need are customers. (DRAINS THE DRINK) Well, better get home to the little woman. (CHUCKLES)

Groundskeeper Willie: (STANDING) It's hard to meet girls when you're paid in chickens.
Dr. Kissingher: (ROLE-PLAYING) Okay, I'm a sexy girl. And research shows that my decision to sleep with you happens in the first six point five seconds. Go.
Groundskeeper Willie: Uh, my name's Willie, and all I do is get drunk and kill squirrels with me shovel.
Dr. Kissingher: "Hi, I'm William. I'm a connoisseur of fine spirits, and I love animals to death.
Moe Szyslak: (STANDS UP) Do me next! Do me next!
Dr. Kissingher: Yahhh! A monster! Save me! (RECOVERING QUICKLY, EMBARRASSED CHUCKLE) Sorry, that was unprofessional. Please, go on.
Moe Szyslak: Name's Moe Szyslak. As a kid, I had roundworm. Heck, I was more worm than boy for a couple of years. I dabbled in Satanism, until I was asked to leave. Oh, uh, and one month I ate nothing but aquarium fish.
Dr. Kissingher: (SIGHS) Your only hope is to use a wingman.
Moe Szyslak: What's a wingman?
Dr. Kissingher: A wingman is a friend--
Moe Szyslak: Whoa, whoa, whoa, now I gotta find a friend?
Dr. Kissingher: You need someone who's secretly on your side, making you look good to women. But he can't be more handsome or appealing than you.
Moe Szyslak: Okay, let's take a flip through the Moe-lodex. Bingo.
Moe Szyslak: That was a weird day.

Marge Simpson: (RECALLING FONDLY) Very romantic. Homer had the basketball game muted the whole time. (CASUAL) Oh, and then I found a gray hair. No big deal.
Julio: Marge... It's time I told you the truth. You've been grayer than a Seattle Cinco de Mayo for years now.
Marge Simpson: Really?
Julio: Yes, the dye not only colors your hair, but the fumes wipe the experience from your mind.
Julio: (COMMANDING, TO ASSISTANTS) Jimothy, Aquanetta, it's touch-up time! Gloves and foil, people! Let's go! Crinkle, crinkle.
Marge Simpson: (REACTS TO JOLTS)
Julio: Oh, Janis, I'm so sorry, can we reschedule? It's a battle of the Blue and Gray and I'm Gaybraham Lincoln, baby.

Marge Simpson: (THOUGHTFUL NOISE) She doesn't seem so worried about her gray hair.

Bart Simpson: I just have one question about hair. Where does mine start? (TOUCHING THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD, GROWING PANIC) Head, head, head, hair... where's the border?
Lisa Simpson: (PANICKY) Oh my God, me too!
Bart Simpson: (ANGUISHED) What are we?!
Marge Simpson: (ANXIOUS) What do you think, Homie?

Homer Simpson: (ANGUISHED NOISE) What has she done?! I feel like I'm married to Richard Gere!
Homer Simpson: I can't talk now, I'm talking to myself! No, no, Homer, go ahead. Thanks, Homer, it'll just be a minute. (TO MOE) What's up?

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I hope I look half as good as you when I give up!
Bernice Hibbert: Such audacity!
Ralph Wiggum: Grandma had hair like that when she went to sleep in her forever box.
Lisa Simpson: You can't listen to those women, Mom. Change threatens them. They didn't like it when the Springfield Shopper started printing in color.
Marge Simpson: Neither did I. I didn't want to know what color the Statue of Liberty was. But you know what? I was wrong. And these ladies are too.
Cashier: (GINGERLY) Ma'am, do you have any kind of a... discount card?
Marge Simpson: What kind of card?

Marge Simpson: The A.A.? No!
Cashier: Oh no, I meant the A.A.--
Marge Simpson: A.A.A.? No, I'm not in triple-A. I don't like their "Westways" magazine. They'll give four diamonds to any place that's got a lid on the toilet.
Cashier: No, I meant the A.A... R...
Marge Simpson: (LOUDLY) P?! (GASPS) The A.A.R.P.?! (OFFENDED) Well that tears it. I don't want this milk and I'm not gonna take it back.
Cashier: (GENTLY) That's okay, we have a young man who does that for you.
Gil Gunderson: Right here, ma'am. Oh boy, a "put back!" I hope it takes me by the freezer section. Stick my head in the pizza case it's like a ski vacation! I can imagine the pepperonis are Swiss chalets nestled in a big layer of mozzarella snow!
Seymour Skinner: Bart, eyewitnesses to your fight described you as "berserkoid," "totally aggro," and said you punched Milhouse "like fifty billion times." That's an excessive number of times.
Seymour Skinner: (KINDLY) What's bothering you, son?

Terri Mackleberry: Still freakin' out 'cause your Mom aged thirty years in a day?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: (EXPLAINING) Don't judge them too harshly. They recently learned they were once two-thirds of conjoined triplets. And the third one is out for revenge. Now Bart, share your most intimate thoughts with me.
Bart Simpson: I don't think I want to.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh... Well, maybe it'd be easier for you to talk to my colleague Doctor Thera-bear.

(Coffee Shop: Int. coffee shop - continuous)
Patty Bouvier: So what does your husband, Vidal Baboon, think of the new look?
Marge Simpson: He loves it! He calls me his "silver belle!"
Selma Bouvier: That means he hates it. If he really liked it he'd just paw at it instead of getting all clever.
Marge Simpson: Why are you always trying to cause trouble with me and Homer? Our marriage is rock solid!
Young Woman #1: So, do you think Homer is gonna be at Club Zipless tonight?
Young Woman #2: I sure hope so.

Homer Simpson: Marge, Marge, put down that broom. You've got nothing to be afraid of from them. I'm a wingman. Part of a great tradition including Val Kilmer from "Top Gun," Wedge Antilles from "Star Wars," and me, from now. And you know why I'm a great wingman? Because I have the confidence that comes from knowing I get to go home to you.
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: And you know what else this whole experience has taught me?
Marge Simpson: True beauty isn't about hair color?
Homer Simpson: Probably.
Marge Simpson: But be honest, when I say "beautiful woman," what pops into your head?
Homer Simpson: Well, I guess I do have a "type."
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - kitchen - LATER THAT NIGHT)
Lisa Simpson: Mom, your choice to go back to blue is so empowering.
Marge Simpson: But you said going from blue to gray was empowering.
Lisa Simpson: Well, as a feminist, virtually anything a woman does is empowering.
Marge Simpson: (GETTING IT) Oh.
Homer Simpson: Is my job creating power, empowering?
Lisa Simpson: No. It's oddly dehumanizing.

Bart Simpson: That's "Angry Dad"! The semi-autobiographical web cartoon I created!

Father: What the hell are you making chairs for? In this family, we sit on the ground!
Herman Millwood: Now Bart, this is where we will help bring your vision to life.
Male Animator: Oh my God, that's Bart Simpson!

Female Animator: Bart, we've got some bad news -- the actor who did the original voice of Angry Dad can't do the movie. He blew out his voice screaming about how he never got paid the first time around.
Bart Simpson: (UNHAPPY) Oh, man. What can we do?
Female Animator: Well, the cartoon's based on your dad -- maybe he can do the voice. Can he get angry on cue?

Lenny Leonard: Okay.

(PROJECTION ROOM: int. PROJECTION room - LATER)

Herman Millwood: Now comes the part where the movie actually starts.
MAN IN THE AUDIENCE: (GEORGE C. SCOTT, INCREDIBLY ANGUISHED) For God's sake, turn it off! Turn it offfff!
Bart Simpson: (SAD MOAN)
Homer Simpson: Don't feel bad, boy. Everyone makes mistakes. Yours is just public and expensive.
Lisa Simpson: You know, your movie's not all bad. If you cut out the stuff that didn't work, it would make a great short film.
Bart Simpson: A short film?
Lisa Simpson: Many great directors, like Wes Anderson, Frank Tashlin, and Tim Burton started with short films.
Bart Simpson: Name one more.
Lisa Simpson: Taylor Hackford.
Bart Simpson: I don't know who that is, but I'm convinced. Let's start cutting.

"Randy Newman": Hi. Yeah, it is me, Ricky Gervais. Uh, Tanqueray gin and tonic, please. I'm paid to drink that in my movies. The amount isn't important. A lot to you, but to be honest, not so much to me.
"Randy Newman": Ah, okay, you missed it, but I just put a tip in there. A big one. Double digits. Ten. The lowest of the double digits. But nevertheless, ten dollars, so, a lot of money... to you. Less to me. Uh, but ten dollars, nonetheless. Look at it.
Randy Newman: The ten? That was there before.
"Randy Newman": It was not! Who else in here's gonna tip ten dollars? Keith Urban, Helen Mirren? I don't think so. They don't have the common touch, do they? Like me. You've seen that. We've bonded, you're thinking "Wow, he's rich, he's famous, he's got great abs." Personal trainer, you couldn't afford that. I used to be fat. I used to eat junk food. You probably still do. But you're going "Wow, look at him. How much did that suit cost him?" Nothing. I got it for free. That's what happens when you're a celebrity. Helen! Helen! She can't hear me. Helen--Mirren! Who does she think she is? Fur coat, no knickers. Anyway, mate, your ice is dripping.
Announcer: And now, to present the Golden Globe for Best Animated Short...

Actor: Sound mixers may not be glamorous, but they make us sound so good.

Bart Simpson: (TRIUMPHANTLY STANDING) Yes!
Bart Simpson: This is it... I finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. It was my sister's idea to make this into a short. And so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. And you know what? It was my Dad's movie too. I only wish he were here and not at Cerritos Auto Square.
Homer Simpson: (WALKING UP) You got your wish, boy. I'm proud of ya. I'm sorry I took all the credit.
Bart Simpson: This whole thing is silly. I mean, isn't the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard?
"Martin Scorsese": (RAPID-FIRE) You make a lot of good points, Bart. A lot of good points. You're a very thoughtful kid, you remind me of Deborah Kerr in "Black Narcissus." Anyway, granted, despite what André Bazin might say, films are a collaborative art form, but, hey, you can't give an Oscar to everyone.

Lisa Simpson: Let me finish: thanks to your wonderful, wonderful drug.
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) It happened to the scorpions too! The flower essence must have the side effect of lubricating the eye sockets to the point of popping.
Grampa Simpson: (CHEERFUL) More saline please!
Marge Simpson: At some point I think we should see a doctor.
Bart Simpson: No, it's cool -- it's like we've got our own monster!
Homer Simpson: Your grandfather is not a monster.
Homer Simpson: Now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town.
Grampa Simpson: Sounds good!
Marge Simpson: (SIGH) At least no one else has taken this drug.
Marge Simpson: Bart, why are you tugging on your collar?
Homer Simpson: (THREATENING) It better be tonsillitis.
Bart Simpson: Well, actually... I may have accidentally traded a few of those pills, for money...
Homer Simpson: (HORRIFIED GASP)
Bart Simpson: ...which I may have already spent, ironically, on these novelty eyeglasses.
Grampa Simpson: Howdy, handsome!
Lisa Simpson: (POINTS OUT WINDOW) Look!
Cat Lady: (HAPPY CAT LADY GIBBERISH) Who loves mommy's eyeballs? Oh there's a kitty gonna sleep good tonight! Yes you are! (CACKLES)
(Springfield Pharmaceuticals: Ext. Springfield PHARMACEUTICALS - day)
Homer Simpson: So, I guess we're all in the same boat, huh?
Walther Hotenhoffer: Nein, nein. My boat is me and hundreds of lawyers. Your boat has you and a lot of people with their eyes falling out.
Marge Simpson: Walther, when a man puts something on a Frisbee, he should stand by it.
Marge Simpson: See?
Walther Hotenhoffer: (LOOKS AT FRISBEE) You are right -- as always, the Frisbee is the mirror to the soul.
Secretary: Mr. Hotenhoffer, there's a mob outside.
Walther Hotenhoffer: An angry mob?
Secretary: No, a cheerful mob.
Walther Hotenhoffer: (LOWERS GUN, SIGHS) I'd like to have just one day when I don't put a gun to my head.
Old-timey Farmer: Now, I ain't much for speeches...
Old-timey Farmer: But we sure do appreciate what you done for us, and we were just hopin' we could get more of that drug. Lots more!
Mob: (AGREEING NOISES)
Walther Hotenhoffer: Those poor googly-eyed fools. I cannot exploit them like this. I will have to be content exploiting their fear of losing hair and penis. I will destroy the drug.
Crowd: (UNHAPPY MURMURS) / What? Well I never!
Homer Simpson: Walther, let's not be so hasty. Who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? Besides, our generation's got everything under control! Now, if you'll excuse me, I was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. To Moe's!
Homer Simpson: Flat tire? No problem!
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Lenny Leonard: Homer, use your head. Just buy a new car!
Homer Simpson: Great idea, but I don't have any money.
Carl Carlson: You could take out a loan with your house as collateral.
Homer Simpson: And I wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! What are the odds of that much time happening?
Lenny Leonard: Pretty close to zero, I'd say.
Homer Simpson: Problem solved. Generation awesome does it again!
Carl Carlson: (DOPEY CHEER)
Grampa Simpson: All right, you googly-eyed geezers, turn up your hearing aids -- I've got something to say.
Kent Brockman: The eight hundred million dollar boondoggle based on nothing more than a cute play on words.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - tv room - cONTINUOUS)
Grampa Simpson: Together, we survived the Depression, won a few wars, and put a man on the moon. In fact, the only mistake our generation made was creating that generation.
Grampa Simpson: If we want to set these bumblers straight it's going to take all the crankiness we can muster. So put down those pills, pop in your eyeballs, and "upside-down" them smiles!
Friends: (IMPRESSED NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Their "can-do" will bail out our "won't-try" every time!
Lisa Simpson: So I guess the lesson here is...
Seymour Skinner: If you go on a field trip, don't break off from the group.
Walther Hotenhoffer: And if you are a fat little boy in a chocolate factory, never try to drink from the river. The tube! My God! Every night I see the tube!
Kent Brockman: (GRIM)...the Queen will be held without bail, until the sample is returned from the lab. (SUDDENLY UPBEAT) And now, it's time for "That's Kent-ertainment!"
Kent Brockman: Here's a story that gives new meaning to the words "puff piece:"
Kent Brockman: Springfield natives Cheech and Chong are returning in triumph for a reunion show!
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) Cheech and Chong are coming back to Springfield?
Lisa Simpson: Cheech and Chong are from Springfield?
Grampa Simpson: Lucy and Desi are getting a divorce?
Kent Brockman: Before they formed their "joint" partnership, Tommy Chong and Richard "Cheech" Marin briefly worked as Channel 6 meteorologists...
Chong: (SERIOUS) Tomorrow, a high pressure front brings a strong possibility of drizzle...
Kent Brockman: Then, the doobie of destiny changed their lives forever, when police burned marijuana seized from the Buddy Rich Orchestra in a nearby lot...
Cheech: (STONED) So, y'know, uh, check your barometer, thermometer, anemometer... Why does everything have to have an "ometer" on it?
Chong: And what is rain, man? It's like we're in the apartment under God, and his fat sister overflowed the tub.
Cheech: (STONED GIGGLES)
Kent Brockman: The duo's herbal ha-has led to a series of successful albums, concerts, movies, and "Nash Bridges." Now, these homegrown heroes will kick off their summer tour at Squidport's new Amphitheatre -- (DRAMATIC) the Clamphitheater.
Bart Simpson: Who the hell are Cheech and Chong?
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP) Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day!
Bart Simpson: Who are Beavis and Butthead?
Homer Simpson: (SMALL HEARTBROKEN SOB) I've failed as a parent. I swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. To the media room!
(THE SIMPSON ATTIC: Int. the Simpson attic - Later)
Chong: Open up. It's the police.
Cheech: Oh man, I gotta get rid of my grass!
Homer Simpson: (GLEEFUL GIGGLES) He's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
Homer Simpson: (CONTENTED SIGH) Back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. Which was about three times.
Lisa Simpson: These are comedy albums?
Lisa Simpson: The Noisy Minority... The Upside-Down Bubblegum Collective... The Regional Lampoon... The Plymouth Grok Experiment... Fro And Flo... Allan Sherman's Helter Shmelter...
Marge Simpson: What are you guys doing up there?
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED NOISE) Hide the dope!
Bart Simpson: We don't have any dope.
Homer Simpson: Then what did I just smoke?
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
(Springfield Clamphitheater: Ext. Clamphitheatre - nigHT)
Chief Wiggum: Lou, I want you to confiscate these brownies.
Lou: There's no drugs in these brownies.
Chief Wiggum: I said confiscate!
Chief Wiggum: Uh, also confiscate me a t-shirt, uh, triple-X-L.
Lou: I thought you said double-X-L was a real wakeup call.
Chief Wiggum: That was for pants.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen: Krusty the Clown!
Krusty the Clown: Thank you. When they asked me to introduce Cheech and Chong, I said "how much?" And they said "we don't pay for introductions," so I said "then I don't need this crummy gig," and they said "yes, you do," and I said... (ENTHUSIASTIC) ladies and gentlemen, Cheech and Chong!
Chong: Who is it?
Cheech: It's me, Dave, man. Open up, I got the stuff. (MORE KNOCKS)
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED GASP) I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
Cheech: Will you open up, I got the stuff with me.

Audience: (CHANTING) Dave's not here!
Audience: Dave's not here! Dave's not here!
Cheech: (SOTTO) Say the line, man!
Chong: (SOTTO) They already know the line. What's the surprise? What's the point?
Cheech: (SOTTO) The point is they still give us a shoebox full of twenties to do this! Now say it!
Chong: (TO AUDIENCE) Dave's not... (BREAKING CHARACTER) Dave's not gonna sell out anymore, man! I, I can't say it!
Audience: (SHOCKED GASPS)
Cheech: (FURIOUS) What are you doing, man?!
Chong: What am I doing?! What am I-- I'm experimenting, man! I'm growing as an artist, okay?
Cheech: That's not the Cheech and Chong brand.
Chong: (IRRITATED) Brand? Brand? I'm a seventy-two year old man. I've eaten eggs every which way they cook 'em -- I can't play it safe anymore.
Cheech: Look, these people pay good money to see "Dave's not here!" You owe them "Dave's not here!"
Chong: Well, how about this? Chong's not here! (SUPER AGGRO) Man!
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
Bart Simpson: Ay carumba!
Audience: (ANGRY MURMURS)
Marge Simpson: Homie, you know all the bits. Maybe you could help him!
Homer Simpson: I can't do reefer comedy -- I'm drunk. Two different animals. (SIPS BEER)
Marge Simpson: Homer Simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. Help him!
Homer Simpson: (TO AUDIENCE) Dave's not here, man!
Audience: (ROARS OF ENTHUSIASM)

Audience: (ROARS APPROVAL)
Cheech: (TO HOMER) Hey man, you're alright! How'd you like to be the new Chong?
Homer Simpson: Yes! (BEAT) Will I get to meet Dave?
Cheech: There is no Dave.
Homer Simpson: How 'bout Don Johnson?
Cheech: It'd be easier to meet Dave.
(Simpson Home: Ext. simpson house - DAY - estabLishing)
Homer Simpson: It is so cool for you to let me go on tour with Cheech.
Marge Simpson: And remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. Save lust and rage for me and the kids.
Homer Simpson: (KINDLY) Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry...
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Awww.
(Springfield Street: ext. springfield street - a little later)
Homer Simpson: I can't believe I'm riding around in Cheech's van! The van made of weed!
Cheech: It's not made of weed.
Homer Simpson: Oh. What's it made of? Hash? Shrooms? (LOUD WHISPER) Lysergic acid diethylamide?
Cheech: No! The van is just made of van.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Cheech: Look, Homer, I really need you to be on your game, you know? A lot of our fans have gone through rehab, so they're much more critical.
Homer Simpson: Don't worry, Cheech. I know all the classic bits of you and Chong.
Cheech: Don't say that name! Now, you drive -- I have to go black out his face on some t-shirts with a Magic Marker.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Can we get high from the fumes?
Cheech: No!
Cheech: (ANGRY BLACKING OUT MUMBLING NOISES, SOME IN SPANISH)
Chong: Okay, man, what I'm looking for in a new Cheech is someone who is, like, open-minded and adventurous. I haven't decided about the mustache yet, but you need your own suspenders.
Lenny Leonard: (TO CARL) Snap, snap!
Carl Carlson: (VERY HURT) Our friendship died with the first snap and you buried it with the second. (STORMS OFF)
Ralph Wiggum: You ever notice how your nose makes boogers? What's up with that?
Chong: Uh... next!

Seymour Skinner: (VERY FLAT) I am your substitute teacher, Sister Mary Elephant. Class, attention, attention, class, class -- shut up! Thank you.
Chong: Uh, no, man. No routines from the old regime.
Seymour Skinner: Really? But Sister Mary's no-nonsense attitude is what inspired me to become an educator.
Chong: Just let your freak flag fly, man.
Seymour Skinner: Well, I guess as long as I fold it afterward and don't display it at night... Oh, perhaps I should improvise, or "do an improv?"
Chong: I want you to reinvent the wheel! No, de-invent the wheel! No -- re-unvent the whool!
Seymour Skinner: Oh, I'll get my prop trunk!
Seymour Skinner: (STAGY) A lot of people have cell phones, but I like to eat healthy. So I invented... (PULLS OUT PROP) the celery phone! (INTO PHONE) Hello? Hello?
Chong: Wow. You are the un-funniest man I've ever seen. Which means, teaming up with you would be totally pushing the envelope.
Seymour Skinner: (INTO PHONE) Mother, how did you get this number -- it's a prop phone! (ROLLS EYES) Yes, I have your celery... I took the limpest stalk there was!
Chong: Stop it! Stop riffing! The gig is yours!

Homer Simpson: (HUGE MOAN) Why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?
(ART MUSEUM: Int. art museum - later)

Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
Marge Simpson: And I wouldn't blame him. You destroyed our son's self-esteem.
Homer Simpson: Well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's room - continuous)
Marge Simpson: I told you you should've stopped the tickling.
Homer Simpson: Now I have to work overtime--
Marge Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: --just to counteract the self-confidence--
Jimbo Jones: Hey Bart, I hear the forecast is for showers... in your pants!

Bart Simpson: (MOANS) Why did I agree to moderate this teleconference?
(Simpson Master Bedroom: Int. Marge and Homer's bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: You can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
Homer Simpson: (OVERLY-AGREEABLE) Well of course, I would love to be a more sensitive father. You know that.
Marge Simpson: That's great. Then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
Homer Simpson: (SMUG) I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
Homer Simpson: (SMALL SHRIEK)
Marge Simpson: There's one right here!
Homer Simpson: Please, Marge, no! The other negligent dads'll make fun of me! They're so cliquey!
Marge Simpson: You'll be fine, you always are.
Homer Simpson: (POUTY) I miss my friends from drunk driving school. (QUIET SOBS) They were so cool.
(COUNSELING CENTER: Int. counseling CENTER - day)
Dr. Zander: Homer, welcome to Fresh Start: a fathering enrichment class. My name is Dr. Zander.
Dr. Zander: Last week we assigned everyone to keep a fathering journal. (LOOKING AT GERALD) Gerald, would you like to share your entries?
Gerald: Absolutely, Dr. Zander. Monday: left work early to see Derek's baseball game. When Derek saw me in the stands, his smile was worth a million dollars. Tuesday: Lost a million dollar account 'cause I left work early Monday.
Dr. Zander: That's great journaling. Comments?
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: I don't want to hurt him, Doc.
Dr. Zander: (PROMPTING) Uh, Homer, it says here you've been a father for ten years. What has that taught you?
Homer Simpson: (SAGELY) Well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. (RECALLING) But, oh, you know, the other day, Bart, the little dickens, said I had an elephant butt. So anyway, I'm strangling him, and I said to Bart...
Dr. Zander: Wait. Hold on a moment. You were strangling your son?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, strangling. I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! (GENIAL CHUCKLE) Right? Anyway, I said "Bart"...
Dr. Zander: You're actually serious! You physically lay your hands on your boy's neck?
Homer Simpson: (NODS, SHRUGS) I guess it's just how I was raised.

Homer Simpson: Hey, Doc. (MUNCHES COOKIE, MOUTH FULL) Where is everybody?
Dr. Zander: I told them not to come.
Homer Simpson: Why didn't you tell me not to come?
Dr. Zander: Homer, to emphasize the seriousness of this situation, I'm going to turn my chair around backwards.
Homer Simpson: (MASSIVE SHOCKED SHRIEK)
Dr. Zander: (CAREFULLY CHOOSING WORDS) I feel, in this situation, the only option is a risky and radical treatment.
Dr. Zander: Homer, meet Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Dr. Zander and I play pick-up basketball on the weekend. And when he told me what you do to your son, I was so disturbed I only scored a hundred and seventy-two points.
Dr. Zander: (PROUDLY) I had eighty-six assists!
Dr. Zander: But today he's here to assist me with you.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) Wha-wha-what are you doing?
Dr. Zander: Homer, it's time you understood what it feels like to be young, small, and terrified.
Homer Simpson: No Doc, please! I'm just a little boy!
Young Grampa: (STRANGLING/BEING STRANGLED NOISES)

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Fool-hearty... tattooed...
Homer Simpson: Dr. Zander, you made me see my life through Bart's neck, and I swear, I will never, ever strangle my boy again.
Dr. Zander: I believe we've made excellent progress here today. And after another few years of twice-weekly sessions we can really...

Dr. Zander: And you're cured.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Homer Simpson: Hello, boy.

Homer Simpson: I want you to know I'm cured.
Bart Simpson: Good for you. No more drinkin'?
Homer Simpson: (SWEET CHUCKLE) Oh son, I can't quit drinking any more than I could quit being a man.
Homer Simpson: (PLEASED NOISE) Now it feels like morning. What I am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship.
Homer Simpson: (FRIENDLY) Go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) I just got up, man.
Homer Simpson: (FRIENDLY) Oh come on, bust your daddy's chops.

Dr. Zander: (GRIM) It's the damn economy. When it went south, the first thing people stopped spending money on was expensive therapists. So we all live here now, along with the other unemployed luxury professionals: wedding planners, personal shoppers...aromatherapists... high-end caterers...
Man In Tux: (GARY BUSEY VOICE) Mushroom cap?

Dr. Zander: (NODS) Mm-hmm -- yes, one of the most common complaints about therapy.

Marge Simpson: We'll do each other's nails, make some brownie sundaes, and watch the four saddest horse movies I could find.
Marge Simpson: "Broken-Leg Beauty," "Sorry, Silver," "No More Mint Juleps..." And the fourth one has a title so sad I can't even say it.
Lisa Simpson: Really? Can I see it?

Ewell Freestone: Peach pickin' ain't so bad, long as you got a song to take your mind off it.

Man: Because this is a house of magic!

Lisa Simpson: Looks like there was magic between you two.
Raymondo: The lady in question is my late wife, Esther. (HEARTFELT) She was the only other soul who knew the secret of my greatest trick. Now I'm alone with my memories and my medical marijuana.
Lisa Simpson: Would you... be interested in teaching me?
Raymondo: A girl illusionist? Ladies are what you saw in half and throw knives at. They never wear the hat.
Lisa Simpson: What if you just taught me one trick?
Raymondo: Fine. These are the Rings of Fate. Come back in a week with these rings linked together, and maybe I'll -- say, you did it already!
Raymondo: Well, I guess I can teach a girl. Blackstone taught a monkey.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not exactly flattered by that.
Raymondo: You should be. That monkey wound up with eighteen car dealerships. If you bought a family car in the St. Louis area, you bought it from the mighty Chimpopo.

Lisa Simpson: There's no chance whatsoever. (LOOKS AROUND) I'll show you.

Raymondo: Imagine if your greatest secret was given to your worst enemy!
THOUGHT-BUBBLE FLANDERS: A peanut-butter-and-pretzel sandwich? (HAPPY MUNCHING) There's no way a stupid Flanders like me could ever have thought of this.
Homer Simpson: (TO RAYMONDO) Okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. So why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down.
Homer Simpson: (SNORING NOISES)
(Simpson Home: INT. SimpSON HOUSE - Lisa's Room - night)
Raymondo: (ENTERING) Hey kid. Nobody likes a gloomy magician. Except, of course Gloomo the Magnificent.
Lisa Simpson: Raymondo! You forgive me!
Raymondo: Not so fast.
Raymondo: But still there is hope.
Raymondo: Lisa, we've all done things we're ashamed of. I briefly became a disco magician. Have you ever tried to put a leisure suit on a bird? You get his pants on, he pulls his coat off. And on it goes. But now I need your help to stop Cregg Demon.

Chief Wiggum: All right, I want close-up magicians on the left, illusionists on the right, and mentalists, well, I don't need to tell you. Ah c'mon, Lou, I need backup!

Chief Wiggum: I'll take the box that doesn't talk back.
Lou: That's just what you need, Chief. Another stomach.
Chief Wiggum: Shut up.

Raymondo: Something's wrong. The trick isn't working!
Boy: (GENUINELY CONCERNED) Dad, don't die!
Lisa Simpson: I'll get him out!
Raymondo: No. We must not interfere.
Lisa Simpson: You're just gonna stand there?
Raymondo: No. With my back I gotta sit.
Cregg Demon: (CRIES FOR HELP)
Raymondo: Ahhh.
Raymondo: Aw, I can't stand you looking at me that way.
Raymondo: That's better.
Lisa Simpson: He's going to die!
Raymondo: Lisa, magicians hate to be rescued. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the little magician's room.
Lisa Simpson: I guess it's up to me to save you, Cregg Demon Magic Freek.
Ricky Jay: You ain't savin' nobody demon nothin' freek.
Lisa Simpson: (RECOGNIZING) Ricky Jay? David Copperfield? (AMAZED) Penn? (MORE AMAZED) Teller?!?!
David Copperfield: We switched the trick milk can with a regular milk can.
Lisa Simpson: But why?
PENN: Because...
Teller: Quiet!
Teller: You talk onstage. I talk offstage. That was the curse the witch put on us.
Ricky Jay: He stole all our best tricks.
David Copperfield: And he stole my sexiest magical gestures! Like this one (DAVID COPPERFIELD GESTURE)
Lisa Simpson: (INVOLUNTARY SWOONING NOISE, THEN:) Wait, I know he's an unethical magician, and his tattoos are a inconsistent mix of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms. But he doesn't deserve to die.
Ricky Jay: We ain't askin', kid. Get her!
Teller: Penn, just drop them!
PENN: I can't! I never learned how!
Homer Simpson: I'll save you, Lisa!
Homer Simpson: (DEFIANT) The real magic is raising three kids in this economy! (CALMLY) You can put the ball back now.
Raymondo: Hands off my apprentice, amateurs!
Lisa Simpson: (GASP HAPPILY)
Ricky Jay: Raymondo? I thought I killed you in Marrakesh.
Raymondo: That was my twin brother! Ruined a lot of my tricks!
Ricky Jay: We might as well finish the job now.
David Copperfield: To show you we mean business, I'm unbuttoning my shirt and turning on a fan.
David Copperfield: (SEXY PREENING NOISES) Oh yeah, it's magical.
Raymondo: (WEARY) I'm just an old man. How could I ever hope to fight you all? Except... with this!
Teller: (MOCKING LAUGH)
Teller: (WOOZY MOANS)
David Copperfield: My beautiful body... no longer properly lit.
PENN: (GASP) My ponytail's been burnt! Teller! The witch's curse is broken!
Teller: Penn... there never was a curse.
PENN: You're a real jerk, you know that?
Lisa Simpson: (PROUDLY) Raymondo, I knew your heart was as pure as the ether that helps you get to sleep. (LOOKS AROUND) Raymondo?
Raymondo: (TRIUMPHANT) I believe the expression is "ta-da!"

Selma Bouvier: So, you here for an eye test? Read this.
Fat Tony: Process my form.
Selma Bouvier: (CONDESCENDING SIGH) I'm afraid this is the wrong form. The one you want is on that table.

Lisa Simpson: Bart, this is a truffle.
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED) You're a truffle.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) A truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots. It's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world.
Bart Simpson: Only you can make tree poop boring.
Lisa Simpson: (AMAZED NOISE) Bart, you can find them by smell! That's amazing! Restaurateurs use highly-trained pigs to sniff these out.
Luigi: (FRUSTRATED) Come on, numb nose. Sniff me a truffle! I don't know why I flew you in from Italy! First class, no less! Plus you forget to get miles!
Lisa Simpson: Interested in these?
Luigi: Eh? (HUGE GASP) Jody Maroni! But where is your truffle pig?
Bart Simpson: (PROUDLY) You're lookin' at him.
Luigi: A human pig! (MAKES SIGN OF THE CROSS) Thank you, Lord, for this abomination.

Fat Tony: What?

Homer Simpson: I'll just sit here quietly.
Homer Simpson: Sorry.
(Beach House: int. beach house - homer & marge's room - later that night)
Homer Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) How could Tony cheat on me so soon?
Homer Simpson: Y'know Selma, from what I've seen here, Fat Tony has a lot of bad influences on him. I walked though a door last night and they were playing cards (LOUD WHISPER) for real money.
Marge Simpson: Well, Homer and I are going to take you away right now.
Homer Simpson: Aw, can't we stay one more day? The Occurrence and I are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled.
Marge Simpson: Sorry, The Occurrence, but to use your lingo, Homer and I have to be "that guy."

Fat Tony: Homer, good morning. May I interest you in a pool noodle?
Fat Tony: We also got pool ziti, pool fusilli -- or if you don't like those, Mama will make you one special!

Old Italian Woman: Tony, we have to leave. For the record, I want to emphasize we're not leaving because today is "cleanup."
Fat Tony: Leave? Why?
Selma Bouvier: (UPSET) Because you have a girlfriend!
Fat Tony: (SIGHS) It is true, but it is not what you think.

Homer Simpson: (AGHAST) That's a wife ring? (COVERING MARGE'S EYES) Marge, don't look!
Marge Simpson: This doesn't make any sense. There was a wedding. You exchanged vows.
Fat Tony: I can explain...
(Springfield Glen Country Club: EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY - flashback)
Fat Tony: If you spoke Italian, which I knew you did not, you would've known that those were goomar-goombah vows.

Selma Bouvier: Si.
Priest: E tu Tony il Grasso prendi Selma come la tua goomar finche non ti rompe i coglioni in presenzi ai tuoi compari?
Priest: Si.
Selma Bouvier: Marge, if I ever tell you I want to get married again, I want you to stick your thumbs into my eyes.
Louie: Yeah, we can show you how to do it. The trick is, don't stop till you hear a pop.
Angela: (TO FAT TONY) You missed my first open house as a licensed real estate broker for this brutta puttana?

Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Homer Simpson: (QUICK, PARANOID) What do I do? Patty's gonna kill me! Unless... I kill her first! I put the body in the car, I dump the car in the lake, I put a James Taylor CD in the stereo so they think it's a suicide...
Lisa Simpson: Why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE) Fine, whatever.

Homer Simpson: That's just what I was going for! (SOTTO TO KIDS) I was going for Scary.
Homer Simpson: You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
Homer Simpson: And stay out!

Milhouse Van Houten: My mom put in the "Finding Nemo" DVD, but then she got a phone call...

Milhouse Van Houten: (GRIM) Not after Chapter One he doesn't.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. springfield elementary - schoolyard - BACK TO SCENE)
Milhouse Van Houten: If death can happen to a fish, it can happen to anyone. So you've gotta live life while you can. So I'm gonna finally proclaim my love for Lisa.
Milhouse Van Houten: That's your take-away from Nemo? I think you've already made your feelings for Lisa clear.
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, I can make them more clear. You see, in the past, I've been too subtle. It's my curse -- SUBTLETY!!!

Lindsay Naegle: Too bad.
Homer Simpson: Just call me "Homer Fingerhands."
Marge Simpson: I'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. But I never knew you were so good with hair.

Marge Simpson: Well... Newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors.

Milhouse Van Houten: (SINGS TO TUNE OF "GREEN SLEEVES") TEACHER SAID DON'T EAT THE PASTE / 'TIS APT TO MAKE YOU SPEW / I ATE THE PASTE, AND LIKED THE TASTE / PASSED OUT AND DREAMED OF YOU.

Taffy: You know so much about body mechanics!
Milhouse Van Houten: LISA LISA...MAID SO FAIR / WITH CRIMSON DRESS AND POINTY HAIR / DO YOU MIND IF I STOP AND STARE / LOOK IN YOUR MIND AND I'M THERE.
Milhouse Van Houten: So, Lisa... I love you. Is that love "requited" or "un"?
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry, but I don't love you, Milhouse, and I never will.
Taffy: I thought that was beautiful.
Milhouse Van Houten: (QUIET, SWEET) You did?
Taffy: Yeah! It was romantic and it rhymed.
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, I used a rhyming dictionary, but it only gives you options. The job of the poet is to say, "This one, I guess."
Taffy: (DELIGHTED GIGGLE) I'm Taffy.
Milhouse Van Houten: Would you like to help me roll the Theremin back to the A.V. closet?
Taffy: It's a date.

Lisa Simpson: (SHAKES HEAD) Why would a popular fifth-grader like Taffy be interested in a Milhouse like Milhouse?

Milhouse Van Houten: Knees, Lisa. Knees.
(Homer's Salon: ext. homer's salon - day)
Luann Van Houten: I know Kirk resents that the dog likes me more, but Rex is just establishing dominance over the weaker male. That's what miniature dachshunds do.
Homer Simpson: (CLOSED-MOUTHED AGREEING NOISES: "MM-HM" AND THE LIKE WHILE LUANN IS TALKING, THEN EXHAUSTED) Oh yeah. Men are such dogs, and vice versa.

Lisa Simpson: Hmm...
Bart Simpson: (READING SCREEN) Hey, that's Taffy's page. Ooh, I see that she's in a relationship.

Bart Simpson: (WHISTLES) I hear he goes to California on his vacations.
Lisa Simpson: (SNAPPING) That's the first thing everyone knows about Kyle LoBianco!
Lisa Simpson: Taffy's up to something. (STANDS) And I won't find out what it is sitting at a computer. It's time to get boots on the ground.

Moe Szyslak: Evening.
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS, THEN RUEFUL) I am never gonna get my homework done tonight.
Lisa Simpson: All right, sister. What's your game?

Taffy: You're not over, you never were! Milhouse, you're a great guy. But we're not gonna work out for one reason.
Milhouse Van Houten: Is it 'cause when I wore cuffed pants they filled up with leaves?
Taffy: That wasn't a great day for us, but... it's because you'll always be in love with her.
Taffy: He likes his apple pie warm and his a la mode cold. Good luck.
Milhouse Van Houten: You don't want me to be with you, you don't want me to be with someone else... how miserable do I have to be before you're happy?
Lisa Simpson: Milhouse, I... I... (GROANS)
Milhouse Van Houten: (HAPPY AGAIN) Lisa, does this mean you like me?

Lisa Simpson: Hi, my name is Lisa Simpson.
Key Man: Ah yes, the Simpsons: a notch and a bump, two notches and a bump.
Lisa Simpson: (NODS) That's us. Do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo?
Key Man: Yeah, but it's gonna cost ya.
Lisa Simpson: How much?
Key Man: Dollar eighty-five. And if you want that little plastic ring around it, now that's gonna cost you another seven cents.
Lisa Simpson: Keep the change.
Key Man: Yes ma'am!
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - after school - day)
Lisa Simpson: How did this bookshelf get here so fast? I bet it's shoddy.
Lisa Simpson: What do you think of that, Nancy Drew?
Lisa Simpson: Jeez, they're dropping like flies.
Lisa Simpson: "The children are on Bus 23." (GASP)
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Bart Simpson: (FRUSTRATED) I'm so sick of keys. They've brought nothing but good luck since I got them.
Cletus Spuckler: Brandine, I think we finally gots us something to cut off that umbrilical cord.
Brandine Del Roy: Well then you got one more mouth to feed.
Brandine Del Roy: (TO CHILD) Y'all want some chocolate milk?
Child: Yes, mama.
Brandine Del Roy: You got it, Embry-Joe.
Child: (SATISFIED NOISE)
(Road: Ext. road - day)
Marge Simpson: That wisenheimer windup toy could be anywhere.
Marge Simpson: Chief Wiggum! Stop that train!
Chief Wiggum: Aw, not through my legs. Oh, that's really rubbin' it in.
Snake Jailbird: (COCKY LAUGH)
Chief Wiggum: Maybe if I use a pen...
Chief Wiggum: Aw jeez, here comes that girl I always liked in high school.
Attractive Woman: Clancy, is that you?
Chief Wiggum: (FEIGNING SURPRISE) Oh ah hey, Maryann. Uh, how are you at getting pants off the ground?
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. Springfield elementary - playground - late afternoon)
Lisa Simpson: Skinner's involved in this. Deep.
Bart Simpson: Crazy classroom, bus full of missing kids... I know who'd have some answers. Someone who's been here a long, long time.
(WOODSHOP: int. woodshop - day)
Nelson Muntz: Yeah, I've been held back more times than I can count... which I guess is why I keep getting held back.
Lisa Simpson: You know anything about... (DRAMATIC) Bus Twenty-three?
Nelson Muntz: (TAKEN ABACK) Whoa, Goldilocks, you best be leaving those bowls of porridge alone.
Lisa Simpson: (TOUGH-TALKING) There's only one bed that's just right for me, the bed with the truth in it. (NOT TOUGH, NORMAL) Which is probably the third one.
Nelson Muntz: (IMPRESSED) All right, I'll tell you. I'll tell you about (OMINOUS) Bus Twenty-three.
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - winter)
Nelson Muntz: It was a cold winter -- two-vest cold.
Nelson Muntz: A bus was loaded with kids for a field trip. I was gonna shake 'em down for field trip money, but what I heard shook me worse than my Dad when I was a baby.
Seymour Skinner: (ALARMED) Sir, this bus is too heavy to cross the ice bridge. They'll have to take a more circuitous route.
Gary Chalmers: There's no time to be safe! Now bang the side of that bus! Bang it twice!
Nelson Muntz: That bus never came back.
Lisa Simpson: So the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge.
Bart Simpson: But it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.
Homer Simpson: Hey, kids!
Homer Simpson: If I tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? (BEAT) Don't drink it!
(SKIES OVER SPRINGFIELD: ext. skies over springfield - a little later)

Homer Simpson: Bart, take the controls!
Bart Simpson: What videogame is this like?
Homer Simpson: Blimp Assassin Three.
Bart Simpson: For Wii or Xbox?
Homer Simpson: Xbox.
Bart Simpson: Original or Three-Sixty?
Homer Simpson: Fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!
(River: ext. river - continuous)
(Blimp: iNT. BLIMP - CONTINUOUS)
Homer Simpson: I'll save you, honey!
Homer Simpson: Boy! Stomp on my head!
Bart Simpson: Yes! And I've got gum on my shoe!
Homer Simpson: (DOPPLER) You're a real jerrrk!
Homer Simpson: (MAD) Why you undead little...!
Lisa Simpson: That's not a real arm -- it's plastic!
Homer Simpson: That doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. He could be a war hero.
Lisa Simpson: No, I mean they're mannequins!
(Underwater: int. underwater - continuous)
(River: ext. river - continuous)

Homer Simpson: (SOBS) All pooted out. (CONTINUES SOBBING)
Marge Simpson: Oh, I'm sorry, Homie.
Homer Simpson: (SOBS) It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present.
Lisa Simpson: Skinner and Chalmers loaded that bus with those kids... but why?
Otto Mann: (QUIETLY) I can tell you why.
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) Otto? Are you the one who left the message on the blackboard?
Otto Mann: Yeah, it was me. I was the bus driver when those sweet young angels were swallowed up by the river. (SOBS) Now I'm gonna join them.
Lisa Simpson: Otto, they're just mannequins!
Groundskeeper Willie: Me bleachers have been weaponized!
Otto Mann: (REALIZES) Then... I'm not responsible for a horrible tragedy! And I didn't do anything wrong by fleeing the scene and not reporting it and killing that hobo with the big mouth. (BEAT) I might have imagined that last part.
Gary Chalmers: Skin-ner!
(Car: Int. Car - continuous)
Gary Chalmers: When I say "drive us to Bolivia," that is your cue to start the damn car!
Seymour Skinner: I can't find the key!
Bart Simpson: (COCKY) Looking for something?
Seymour Skinner: Yes. My car key.
Bart Simpson: (COCKY) Does it look like... this?
Seymour Skinner: Yes. Quite a bit.
Gary Chalmers: He's got your key, Seymour.
(Mysterious Basement Classroom: int. mysterious basement classroom - later)
Seymour Skinner: I suppose you want to know why this all happened. Picture what I'm describing in your minds.
(NEW SCHOOL: ext. new school - later - FLASHBACK)
Seymour Skinner: Years ago we received a government grant to improve the school. Unfortunately, I cashed it...and the money was in my pants when mother did the laundry.
Seymour Skinner: (TO HIS MOTHER) But these pants were good for another day.
Agnes Skinner: That's not your decision.
Seymour Skinner: I'm the boss of my own laundry!
Agnes Skinner: Well, you don't have to sleep next to you!
(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elementary - basement - flashback)
Gary Chalmers: To keep the feds from coming after us, we built the phony schoolrooms that you saw.
(Circular Classroom: int. circular classroom - day - flashback)
Gary Chalmers: So all you had to do was fill the class with mannequins and take a few pictures.
Gary Chalmers: Yes, except for one small glitch. We could only afford to rent the mannequins.
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP)
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - winter - flashback)
Seymour Skinner: If we didn't get them back by five, we'd be charged for the extra day.
Gary Chalmers: And they didn't pro-rate.
Homer Simpson: (BIGGER GASP)
Gary Chalmers: Otto, maybe it was wrong of us to let you think you killed twenty-four children -- who could say?
Seymour Skinner: Abandon gym!
Bart Simpson: (DELIGHTED GETTING CHASED LAUGH)
Lisa Simpson: Well, there's one thing you didn't count on: my Dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car.
Seymour Skinner: We planned for the wedding cake, we just didn't see the baby thing coming.
Gary Chalmers: Well, you should've.
Seymour Skinner: How could I? She wasn't even born yet.
Gary Chalmers: People have babies!
(Springfield: Ext. Springfield - day)
Otto Mann: Not to worry. They're just mannequins.
Milhouse Van Houten: No we're not!
Otto Mann: Maybe we'll fall real slow like "Inception."
Otto Mann: Oops. Guess not.
(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elementary - GYM - continuous)
Seymour Skinner: (APPLAUDS) Well done, the band. We're all bursting with pride after our girls' basketball team beat Shelbyville two-nothing in triple overtime! Now let's make some noise!!! Using our (LOUD) INSIDE VOICES!
Kids: (QUIET CHEER)
Seymour Skinner: Please welcome Springfield Elementary's own ("PYU-MAS") Lady Pumas!
Kids: (EXTREMELY PUZZLED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry, but the team all got food poisoning at the pre-rally egg salad sandwich party. Luckily, as equipment manager, (TRIUMPHANT) I... was not... invited! Woo-hoo!
Seymour Skinner: No team? (SIGHS) I guess I just have to give you all an hour of free play.
Audience: (RIOTOUS APPLAUSE)
Nelson Muntz: Let chaos reign!
Lisa Simpson: (YELLING OVER BAND) Actually, I do have a speech prepared!
Seymour Skinner: Excellent! Free play cancelled!
Kids: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Bart Simpson: No one cancels my free play!
Bart Simpson: Sorry, man.
Milhouse Van Houten: It's okay. Thanks for making me part of the revolution!
Seymour Skinner: Edna, control your student! He's ruined more assemblies than the afternoon sun in the west window!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: He's uncontrollable! Pumpkin stickers mean nothing to him!
Seymour Skinner: That's crazy talk!
Kids: (FALLING/GETTING FALLEN ON NOISES)
Bart Simpson: Whee!
Homer Simpson: (CALLING) Little help...
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (FURIOUS) You unrepentant little twerp!
Miss Hoover: (AGHAST) Oh, Edna!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (HOLDS UP PALM) It was an open hand! Does that help?
Seymour Skinner: Edna, we can tolerate mild alcoholism, leaving melted cheese in the microwave, even selling A's for cigarettes. But in laying a hand on a student, you have crossed a line.
Seymour Skinner: (TO SCHOOL NURSE) Nurse, get a slap kit.
School Nurse: (DORIS GRAU VOICE) Right away, sir.
(Springfield Elementary School Hallway: Int. Springfield elementary hallway - day)
(Skinner's Office: INT. SKINNER'S OFFICE - continuous)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (SAD) In all my years of teaching, I've never raised a hand to a student.
Homer Simpson: But you learned! You grew!
Marge Simpson: No! You should never raise your hand to a child. Just leave the crust on their sandwiches. They'll get the message.
Gary Chalmers: Rest assured, Mrs. Simpson, that we have a zero-tolerance policy for this sort of thing when it occurs in front of witnesses.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: What's going to happen to me?
Gary Chalmers: Edna, you're suspended with full pay until the hearing, which is currently scheduled for fifty-seven years from tomorrow. (OFF KRABAPPEL'S LOOK) It was going to be sixty, but I moved it up because (CHUCKLES) I like the way you torment Skinner.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (HOPEFUL) So I still get my check, but I get to stay at home?
Seymour Skinner: I'm afraid it's not quite that simple.
Gary Chalmers: Uh Seymour, who's running this meeting?
Homer Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) I thought I was.
Gary Chalmers: Edna, until the state disciplinary committee rules on your case, every workday you'll report to a school board holding facility -- an educational limbo as it were, where you are the un-baptized dead baby.
Seymour Skinner: They never seem to like that analogy.
(Imposing Downtown Springfield Building: ext. imposing downtown springfield building - day)
(Administrative Detention Room: int. administrative detention room - day)
Gary Chalmers: This is the (MAKES AIR QUOTES) "Rubber Room," where accused teachers are held until the school board decides what to do with them. You show up here every day, seven a.m. to four p.m. Shoes remain on and cell phones remain off. No wi-fi, and you may not refer to this experience as Kafkaesque or Orwellian.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I have to come here every day?!
Gary Chalmers: Or, you could quit.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Gary Chalmers: The only thing I'd like more is if I could quit.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, I'm not quitting. I'm staying here till you give me my job back.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: So, what do you do for fun here?
Jasper Beardly: You'll find ways to pass the time. Me, I watch that crack in the ceiling.
Jasper Beardly: Hey, find your own crack!
Gary Chalmers: Now before I leave, let me turn on this malfunctioning air conditioner.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Is that ice?
Gary Chalmers: No, no, they're spider eggs.
Gary Chalmers: He's a science teacher, he'll know what to do.
(DETENTION FACILITY: Ext. detention facility - day - establishing)
(RUBBER ROOM: INT. RUBBER ROOM - continuous)
Bart Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) Psst! Mrs. K!
Bart Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) Down here!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Haven't you caused enough trouble?
Bart Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) You shouldn't suffer for my bad deed. It should just go unpunished forever.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (FLAT) Fine, half-assed apology accepted. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a lot of very important things to do.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: What else do you wanna talk about?
Bart Simpson: Meet me in the bathroom.
Bart Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) Check this out: a dead possum.
Bart Simpson: Aye carumba!
(Bathroom: int. bathroom - continuous)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Okay, Bart, what's going on? I'm a teacher in a bathroom with a student. That's why most of these people are here in the first place.
Bart Simpson: Mrs. K., I'm here to spring you.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, that's kind of you. Especially after I nearly choked the life out of you.
Bart Simpson: You didn't do that.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: No, but that's what I told everyone I did to earn the respect of the gangs.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: But I can't just wander out of here whenever I feel like it.
Bart Simpson: (SLY) Who says you're leaving?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (AMAZED GASP) You made a dummy of me?
Bart Simpson: (DOWNPLAYING) Mm, I use it to workshop my pranks.
Bart Simpson: Now follow me!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (NERVOUS NOISE) I don't know about this.
Bart Simpson: I can't believe a middle-aged woman is scared of a three-story drop.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (ANNOYED) I'll show you who's middle-aged!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (SCARED NOISE)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Oh great! The one day I put cream cheese on my bagel!
Ned Flanders: Did a volcano erupt in Candyland? 'Cause I just caught me a flyin' red hot!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ha! (THEN ATTRACTED) Ah...
(Administrative Suspension Building: ext. administrative suspension building - continuous)
Ned Flanders: You know, I don't believe we've ever been formally introduced. (REACHES INTO WALLET) Anyhoo, so I don't commit the deadliest of sins... omission... here's my card.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Edna Krabappel. Good luck finding a rhyme for that.
Ned Flanders: Okay, Ms. Krabappel, what made you topple?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Oh, your card doesn't lie.
Ned Flanders: Well, I'm a truthful kinda guy.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: And I like how it's printed in orange.
Ned Flanders: (THINKS HARD, THEN STUMPED NOISE)
Ned Flanders: So, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the "Flanders arms."
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (RUEFUL) For some reason I was following the advice of one Bart Simpson.
Ned Flanders: Bart Simpson? Why, he lives right next door to me! Yeah, when they made him, they did not skimp on the puppy dog tails.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (NODS) And what about that father?
Ned Flanders: Homer? (DIPLOMATIC CHUCKLE) Yeah, he's the peanut in your popcorn... lots of fun... I guess. So, what say we have lunch?
(MALL RESTAURANT: int. mall restaurant - half an hour later)
Ned Flanders: ...Y'know, I wouldn't mind Homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (FISHING) I'll bet your wife doesn't like it.
Ned Flanders: Oh, I'm afraid my Maudie's putting plastic on the clouds now.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (SECRETLY PLEASED) Oh, you poor man.
Ned Flanders: Besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... The Leftorium. We've been the anchor store in the "sad mall" for the last ten years.
Ned Flanders: (OBLIVIOUS) And you're a former Mrs. (MAKING CONVERSATION) So, uh... where's your husband buried?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Probably between the hooters of a coat check girl in Shelbyville. Ha!
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Oh boy, that laugh is infectious. (TRYING IT OUT) Ha!... Ha!... that's fun!
(Springfield Street: ext. springfield street - later)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (WARMLY) Thank you for lunch, Ned.
Ned Flanders: Well thank you for taking me to that Pinkberry place. It's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. Crossin' it off my "do-not-go" list.
Ned Flanders: Well sir, I guess I better refenestrate ya.
Ned Flanders: (CLEARS THROAT) Any chance I could see you again?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (PLAYFUL) You know, I am a fallen woman...
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Whoa, slow down. I never go to "second entendre" on the first date.
Angry Female Teacher: You've been in there for three hours! What are you doing, taking a bath?
Homer Simpson: Awww...
(RUBBER ROOM: Int. rubber room - day)
Gary Chalmers: Good news, Edna. The governor crushed the teacher's union so you don't have to stay here anymore. Now I can just fire you.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Where will I go?
Gary Chalmers: I'll rehire you. But you will have to work weekends as a prison guard.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, I would get a chance to see lots of my former students. You've got a deal.
(Edna's Apartment Building: Ext. edna's apartment building - evening)
(Edna's Apartment: int. edna's apartment - continuous)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Mmm! Getting sprung really made me feel like celebrating. Let's see what you're hiding under this sweater.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Huh. Well, maybe I should lose a layer.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (SUGGESTIVE NOISE)
Ned Flanders: (DEEP BREATH) Edna, you're a very beautiful woman... but I'm a little uh, you know... uncomfortable with premarital sex.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Oh come on, Ned, we've both been married before. Those two boys of yours weren't delivered by stork.
Homer Simpson: Little help... little help... Flanders, little help?
Ned Flanders: Oh yes they were! We deliberately chose a Doctor Stork so we could say it without lying.
Ned Flanders: But I think if we hold off for a while, you'll find I'm well worth the wait. Like a mild cheddar I get tangy when I'm sittin' on the shelf.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Okay, I'll try it your way. But can I at least nibble on the cheese?
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Well, a little nibble won't hurt your appetite.
Ned Flanders: You have the energy for one more?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Absolutely. This is the best DVD about cheese-making I've ever seen.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Oh, great.
Ken Burns: Episode Seventeen: Muenster.
Ned Flanders: Oh, what the heck. I know it's impolite to make a move till episode twenty-five of a Ken Burns documentary, but you're that special.

Ned Flanders: That's right, I'm down to my wife-blesser.

Bart Simpson: Mrs. K.? Are you still bumping moustaches with Ned?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (IRRITATED) Yes. And the way things are going, you're going to be seeing me here a lot.
Bart Simpson: (HORRIFIED) Even on snow days?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Snow days, strike days, half-day afternoons, and all summer long! By the way -- you forgot to bring home your math worksheet.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: It's due tomorrow -- no excuses.
Bart Simpson: But... what if my dog eats it?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: That's the dog that's always eating your homework?
Bart Simpson: Yeah... um... he hates how learning has taken me to a place he'll never go. See?
Bart Simpson: Hang on. Wait a minute.
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(FLANDERS BACK YARD: Ext. Flanders back yard - day)

Homer Simpson: Oh, absolutely, Ned. Sorry.
Homer Simpson: (STIFLING LAUGHTER) Little help...
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - day - establishing)
Homer Simpson: (GENIAL) Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy will put Jack back in the box.
Homer Simpson: Okay, time to go back in the... night-night... (INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED) This is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... I thought we had a deal, man!
Homer Simpson: Well, if it isn't the local school marm... and his new girlfriend. (CHUCKLES, LOUD WHISPER) That's a burn on you, Flanders.
Ned Flanders: (MILD CHUCKLE) Pretty funny, Homer.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: It's not funny at all. Homer, I'd appreciate it if you weren't so rude to Ned.
Homer Simpson: Whoa! Flanders, this chick does not get our thing!
Ned Flanders: (AWKWARD) Actually... she sort of does.
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Homer, do you know how lucky you are? Ned is a wonderful, caring man, and a darn good neighbor!
Ned Flanders: (CHIDING) Language.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, language.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Sorry, Ned, but I can't watch this guy push you around anymore.
Homer Simpson: (SPUTTERING NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Marge, tell her how I don't push Ned around.
Marge Simpson: Actually, sometimes you do push Ned around.
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED NOISE) (FRUSTRATED NOISES)
Marge Simpson: Don't do that, Homie. It rubs off your side hair.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Hey Ned, can I borrow some hair?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Which brings me to item number two on the agenda: I understand you borrowed a thing or two from Ned that you never returned...
Ned Flanders: And I'll just take my tumbleweed back...
Bart Simpson: See, Dad? Having Krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. Teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. We're natural enemies, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
Homer Simpson: Don't panic, son. We can bust up Teachy and Preachy. Here's what we do: I'll take Flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. You scare Rod and Todd by telling them Krabappel will become their evil stepmother.
Bart Simpson: If fairy tales have taught us one thing, it's that first wives are perfect, second wives are horrible.
Homer Simpson: Just the opposite of real life.
(Moe's Tavern: ext. moe's - day - establishing)
Homer Simpson: Yeah, isn't this place great? If you're single you can come here every night.
Ned Flanders: I don't wanna come here. Last time I did, someone slipped me a Mickey and wrote "CHURCHY JOE" on my face.
Carl Carlson: (GIGGLE)
Moe Szyslak: It's your own fault. You gotta read the coaster.
Ned Flanders: Oh my.
Homer Simpson: Ned, let's cut to the chase.
Ned Flanders: Yeah, let me guess. You're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' Edna.
Homer Simpson: Ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' Edna, then I don't wanna be brainheaded.
Ned Flanders: Homer, listen to me. For a long time now I've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with Marge. Then I remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine. (CONTINUING)
Ned Flanders: Someone to hold the other end of the sheet when I fold it up. (WISTFUL) Someone to put in my prayers.
Homer Simpson: (CHOKED UP) Oh Ned, I never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude.
Ned Flanders: That's right. And like any man, I put on my secret Christian underpants one leg at a time.
Homer Simpson: (SOBS) Oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss.

Homer Simpson: Fellow barflies! To Ned Flanders and Edna Krabappel!
Barney Gumble: What a fox!
Carl Carlson: Yes! To Edna!
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, that broad is some dame!
Ned Flanders: (SURPRISED) You all know Edna?
Barney Gumble: Oh yeah, man!
Carl Carlson: Everybody knows Edna.
Seymour Skinner: (HOLDING TWO-THIRDS-EMPTY BEER MUG) We made sweet music in the band room, poetry during English class, and you don't wanna know what we did in the multi-purpose room.
Homer Simpson: (TO SKINNER AND BARFLIES) Shut up.
Comic Book Guy: My email address is Edna-lover-one-seventy-two. It was the lowest number I could get!
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO) Guys, quit telling the truth!
Joey Kramer: Yeah, Edna's amazing.
Ned Flanders: Joey Kramer? The drummer from Aerosmith?
Joey Kramer: Yup, that's me! And after a night with Edna, I couldn't walk this way, that way, or any other way. Ooh la la!
Ned Flanders: Wait... you've all (GULPS) plucked a peach from her tree?
Homer Simpson: Um... uh... (ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE SUBJECT) So uh, Joey, is Wikipedia accurate when it says "Walk This Way" was inspired by "Young Frankenstein?"
Ned Flanders: Well Homer, you really put one over on old stupid Flanders, here. (SADLY) Thanks a lot, neighbor.
Homer Simpson: Don't you mean "neighboreeno?"
Ned Flanders: No. Just plain neighbor.
Homer Simpson: You stupid jerks! I can't believe you could be so cruel! Especially you, Joey Kramer!
(Edna's Apartment: ext. Edna's apartment - a few nights later - establishing)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ned, is anything wrong? You've been acting distracted all night.
Ned Flanders: Oh I was just wondering how many boxes of staples I should order for the store. Does ten sound like a lot to you? Twenty? Fifty? What does sound like a lot to you?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: What exactly are we talking about here?
Ned Flanders: (SIGH) Maybe we should just call it a night.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (A LITTLE SURPRISED) Oh... okay. See you tomorrow?
Lenny's Face: Yeah, give me a kiss, Neddy boy!
Skinner's Face: That's right. Kiss all the men that have ever made their way to Edna's adventurous tongue.
Comic Book Guy's Face: Including me! I shall be discreet in my tweets but brutal in my blog.
Joey Kramer: We made love in so many elevators.
Patty Bouvier: Experiment.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (ALARMED) What is it?
Ned Flanders: (PANICKY BREATHS) I can't do it! (HORRIFIED) Edna, call me Delta Airlines 'cause I can't handle your extra baggage.
Moe's Face: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No leavin' until we all spook you on Edna's face. (AS IF CALLING OVER HIS SHOULDER) All right, pipe down back there, you'll get your chance!

Marge Simpson: Well, there's Ned out on his power walk. Maybe you should talk to him.
Homer Simpson: Wha? My doctor said "don't walk."

Homer Simpson: I know, I know you're not comfortable with all the guys Edna's seen around town.
Cletus Spuckler: (DRIVING PAST IN A JALOPY) And country!
Homer Simpson: Ned, I've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! Endless, endless forgiving!
Homer Simpson: And didn't the Easter bunny himself say "forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?" And if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and Edna can find a way to make it work.
(Flanders Home: Ext. Flanders house - day - establishing)
Ned Flanders: Edna, I had a long walk with Homer Simpson yesterday, and as I was carrying him back home, I had a lot of time to think.
Ned Flanders: (VERY MAGNANIMOUS) You've been with a lot of men, but I forgive you!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: You "forgive" me? (STEAMED) You sanctimonious prude! Who are you to judge how I've lived my life? (WITH ATTITUDE) Ned, I'm not ashamed of dating those men, I'm proud.
Comic Book Guy: (OUTSIDE WINDOW) I still wear your bra!
Homer Simpson: (SNEAKY CHUCKLE)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well, not exactly proud, but I'm stuck. (WITH ATTITUDE, WAGGING FINGER) Ned, if we're gonna stay together, you have to promise that my past will never, ever get in our way.
Ned Flanders: I guess this is gonna have to be decided by a higher power.
Marge Simpson: So we're going to let the internet decide. Should Ned and Edna stay together? Visit thesimpsons.com and vote.
Marge Simpson: We'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. Probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.
Homer Simpson: There's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name.
Marge Simpson: Homer! Stop teasing!
Homer Simpson: Right. Teasing.
Homer Simpson: I'm waitin' for ya.

Homer Simpson: (SNEAKY CHUCKLE) While I'm here, I might as well pre-punch out...
Homer Simpson: (CONSIDERING) Hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. Better put in some overtime.
Homer Simpson: Larry, my man!
Homer Simpson: (REALIZING) Hey, you're not Larry. How come you're not Larry?
Security Guard: (POLITE, BRUSQUE) I wouldn't know, sir.
Homer Simpson: Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that...
Homer Simpson: The warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.
Homer Simpson: (ENTICING NOISE)
Security Guard: Not interested.
Homer Simpson: Wha?!
Homer Simpson: Sheez!
Carl Carlson: Hey, what's with that new security guard? He's acting all aloof. By the way, that's my word of the day: "he's."
Homer Simpson: Maybe I was a little hard on him, expecting him to be Larry right away. By the way, where is Larry?
Lenny Leonard: Crazy house.
Carl Carlson: Violent ward.
Homer Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS) Good ol' Larry.
Homer Simpson: Say... (READS BADGE) Wayne, I couldn't help but notice that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol. You want to go grab a beer after work?
Wayne: I prefer not to have social interaction with coworkers. It, um... hasn't worked out for me in the past.
Homer Simpson: (TO SELF) Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping.
FEDEX-TYPE GUY: Hey, Wayne.
Homer Simpson: (VOWING) As God as my witness, this fist will be bumped.

Lisa Simpson: (A LITTLE HYPER) I like routine. I like routine.
Marge Simpson: Did you have a hard day too?
Homer Simpson: No, a guy at work seems not to like me. I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay.
Marge Simpson: (COMFORTING) It's big to you. Would you like a "get well" pork chop?

Saloonkeeper: (MOE VOICE, FURIOUS NOISE) I'm mad at you for some reason!
Saloonkeeper: (DYING NOISE)
Bart Simpson: (AMAZED) I've never said this before, but I'd like to learn more!
(Public Library: INT. public library - day)
Bart Simpson: Man, Teddy Roosevelt killed more Spaniards in one day than most people do in their whole lives!
Gary Chalmers: (CHECKS WATCH) Y'know, I hate to say it, Bart, but the library is about to close.
Bart Simpson: Really? I wanted to learn more about trust busting. (DOES KARATE MOVE) Take that, Standard Oil!
Gary Chalmers: Tomorrow, son. Tomorrow.
Bart Simpson: Well, I've learned a lot today. Now to go home and let TV slowly rot it all away.
Gary Chalmers: Eh-eh-eh-eh. Not so fast. Teddy Roosevelt believed you could learn from books. But he also believed you could learn just as much from the out-of-doors.
Bart Simpson: I thought teachers only went outdoors to smoke and cry.
Gary Chalmers: (SIGHS) Yes... Son, have you ever seen a horse your father wasn't betting on?
Bart Simpson: No sir.
Gary Chalmers: Come with me.
(Mt. Springfield: Ext. Mt. Springfield - day)
Gary Chalmers: (HEARTY LAUGH) So Bart, what have you learned so far?
Bart Simpson: Well, when horses poop, they don't stop. They just keep walking.
Gary Chalmers: Uh, yes. Well here's another fun fact for you. All around you is a national park... created by Teddy Roosevelt.
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Wow. And here I thought God created all this. Thanks for setting me straight.
Gary Chalmers: Well, wait, I didn't mean that...
Bart Simpson: You've filled my head with horse poop and atheism! And all these years I thought I was unteachable.
Gary Chalmers: Let's stop talking now.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSOn house - establishing - evening)
Bart Simpson: "A man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards."
Bart Simpson: Just quoting our twenty-sixth president, Lis. You could use a little T.R. in your life.
Lisa Simpson: Please! I went through my T.R. phase in first grade. Now I realize that the greatest Roosevelt is Franklin.
Bart Simpson: Balderdash! Teddy Roosevelt protected America's wildlife!
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, so he could shoot it himself. Franklin Roosevelt led this country through the depression and World War Two!
Lisa Simpson: Face on a dime!
Bart Simpson: Face on a mountain!
Grampa Simpson: (ENTERS ANGRY) I hated the Roosie-velts and all them family dynasties. The Kennedys, the Bushes, Jon Voigt and Angelina Jolie, Mayor Daley and his smart ass son, the Daily Show.
Lisa Simpson: That's a lot of anger, Grampa.
Grampa Simpson: Well, I like Stephen Colbert, but that's because I don't get the joke.

Milhouse Van Houten: I love Teddy Roosevelt because he had asthma as a boy!
Jimbo Jones: I love him because he said, "Bully!"

(Springfield Street: Ext. Springfield street - day)
(Chalmers' House: Int. Chalmers' house - continuous)
Gary Chalmers: I'd be glad to have you boys join our experiment in manly education. (SIPS BOURBON) The fact is, today's modern schools have completely failed you.
Jimbo Jones: School failed me? (THINKS) Does school have to go to summer Jimbo?
Gary Chalmers: Look at him, boys. He is the canary in the coal mine of a dying empire.
Jimbo Jones: You're in my coal mine now, bitches!
Gary Chalmers: (NODS) Yeah. Boys are falling behind in every subject -- because our classrooms are entirely geared towards girls! It's all about (CONTEMPTUOUS) feelings, and celebrating differences...
Milhouse Van Houten: But I loved reading "It's Cool to Cry!"
Gary Chalmers: Well, it's not cool to cry!
Milhouse Van Houten: (SMALL SOBS)
Gary Chalmers: Boys need to explore! Build things! Wreck those things! And then build them again! Our first lesson begins this Saturday -- with an overnight trip to Springfield Forest.
Gary Chalmers: Legend has it that Teddy Roosevelt visited the forest and lost a pair of his trademark spectacles. This weekend we set forth in search of those spectacles!
Boys: (WHOOP AND CHEER)
Jimbo Jones: This is all well and good, but I must know: what are spectacles?
Gary Chalmers: (ROLLS EYES) Glasses.
(Springfield Forest: ext. springfield forest - a little while later)
DOLPH: One time I found an old washing machine over there that still had clothes in it.
Boys: (IMPRESSED NOISES)
Nelson Muntz: This place is as beautiful as the side of a Coors beer can. (SAD) The kind my Dad used to leave in the bathtub.
Gary Chalmers: There are no bad fathers in the wilderness, boy.
(Campsite: ext. campsite - the next morning - DAWN)
Lisa Simpson: Bart, what are you doing?
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - night - establishing)
Gary Chalmers: Y'know, Bart, morning's when I miss my Rosemary the most. She sure looked good in a pair of jammies.
Nelson Muntz: (EXCITED) Dinguses! DINGUSES!
Nelson Muntz: I found 'em! Teddy Roosevelt's spectacles!
Gary Chalmers: Nicely done, Muntz!
Nelson Muntz: Could this be the moment my life starts to turn around? The moment I... huh?
Nelson Muntz: (DOPPLER) Gravity blows!
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE)
State Comptroller Atkins: Gary, you took these boys on an unauthorized field trip, and look what happened!
Gary Chalmers: He got some bumps and bruises and a thistle in his britches. What is the big deal?
Mrs. Muntz: The big deal is I'm gonna sue you! Got me one of them "abogados" from the bus ads. He says he'll only take veinte por ciento, whatever that is.
Lawyer: (SPANISH ACCENT) You have seen my picture on the side of a bus. And I am not smiling because I lost the case.
Nelson Muntz: Haw haw!
Mrs. Muntz: (TO ATKINS AND SKINNER) I'm gonna take you for every peso you've got.
Seymour Skinner: (SOTTO TO ATKINS) How did she know we get paid in pesos?
Gary Chalmers: They took my job away, boys.
Otto Mann: Where to, boss?
Gary Chalmers: Just drive.
Gary Chalmers: Maybe it is cool to cry.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Who can name the three types of rocks?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart Simpson?
Bart Simpson: Chalmers would actually take us out to see the rocks.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: You can see the rocks on page thirty-two of your science book.
Bart Simpson: (LOOKING DOWN) My book is missing page thirty-two.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Put your head on the desk and shut your eyes.
Bart Simpson: My desktop is sticky with soda from the kid that had it before me.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Do as I say!
Bart Simpson: (MOANS)
(Springfield Street: Ext. Springfield street - day)
Gary Chalmers: Stupid fish! Don't you want to be my ("SKIN-NER") din-ner?!
Bart Simpson: (TENTATIVE) Hey, Gary.
Gary Chalmers: No.
Gary Chalmers: (SAD SIGH) Simpson, you are looking at a man who was not good enough for the worst public school in America.
Bart Simpson: Well, what would Teddy Roosevelt do?
Gary Chalmers: Son, I'm no Teddy Roosevelt. I'm not even Kermit Roosevelt.
Bart Simpson: (HUGE GASP OF SHOCK)

Bart Simpson: I call this meeting of the Brotherhood of the Spectacles to order. Our mission: to get Chalmers back his job.
Other Boys: Hear hear! Hear hear!
Homer Simpson: Bart, I wanna ask you about something I read in a magazine. (STERNLY) Are you boys cyberbullying each other?
Jimbo Jones: How could we be? We're all in the same place and we don't have computers.
Homer Simpson: (CALLING OUT) Marge, I parented!
Marge Simpson: That's great, Homie! Come have some ice cream on a brownie!
Homer Simpson: (TO BOYS) Later, losers.
Bart Simpson: I'm thinking of something big. So big it involves (DRAMATIC) taking over the entire school and not giving it up till Chalmers gets his job back!
Homer Simpson: (A LITTLE EXASPERATED) Bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse.
Bart Simpson: (CONFESSING) Well, Dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe I should tell you...
Homer Simpson: (LOOKS DOWN, MOANS) Marge, my ice cream's melting and I haven't finished my brownie!
Marge Simpson: (A LITTLE EXASPERATED) Come in and get some more!
Homer Simpson: You guys need to get a woman.
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. Springfield Elementary - day - establishing)
Jimbo Jones: (SLIGHTLY STILTED) So, I'm considering taking drugs. Would the school advise for or against that?
Receptionist: Oh, strongly against! Would you like to read this pamphlet?
Jimbo Jones: (FLIRTATIOUS) Oh well, would you read it with me?
Receptionist: (FLIRTATIOUS GIGGLE)
Receptionist: You see? This boy took drugs and his scores suffered.
Jimbo Jones: (INTRIGUED AGREEING NOISES) Yeah.
Bart Simpson: (HOLDING NOSE) There's a car with its lights on in the teacher's lot.
Bart Simpson: Late-'90s model...coffee stains on front seat...
Bart Simpson: Taking over the school. With all the kids inside!
Lisa Simpson: What?! I'm telling Mom!
Bart Simpson: Great. You can call her from the closet phone.
Lisa Simpson: Hello, Mom? You won't believe what Bart's doing.
Bart Simpson: There really is a phone in there?
Bart Simpson: (SCOFFS) So immature.
Bart Simpson: Yo, teachwads! The Brotherhood of the Spectacles has taken over the school!
Dewey Largo: (MOCK HORROR) Oh no, please. Don't make us start our weekend early.
Miss Hoover: Our paychecks are in there.
Dewey Largo: (EAR-SPLITTING SCREAM, THEN:) Why didn't I sign up for direct deposit!
Seymour Skinner: Bart, open this door now -- or I will jiggle the handle indefinitely!
Bart Simpson: Suit yourself. We all rubbed it with boogers.
Seymour Skinner: (FREAKED-OUT) Damn! Willie, break it down!
Nelson Muntz: Not so fast!
DOLPH: Back it up, or the photocopier eats it!
Seymour Skinner: (GASPS) Oh my God! We've got a thirty-year mortgage on that photocopier! (GRIM) Willie, stay your tractor!
Groundskeeper Willie: Ye can't just turn her on and off like that!
Groundskeeper Willie: Oh, I guess you can.
Bart Simpson: Okay, we've gotta stay focused: Jimbo, gather all the students in the gym. Milhouse, take a nap. You know how cranky you get.
Milhouse Van Houten: (CRANKY) I do not!
Kent Brockman: (TO CAMERA) Dog Day Afterschool?! This is Kent Brockman outside Springfield Elementary with the parents of lockdown leader Bart Simpson.
Marge Simpson: He's not a bad boy.
Marge Simpson: He had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.
Homer Simpson: (MAD) Are you covering me up?!
Kent Brockman: (ADMITTING) Yes, I'm afraid we are.
Homer Simpson: (LECTURING) The least I can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. (EXPLAINING) It's kind of my way of sending a Christmas card. (WAVES AT CAMERA) Happy Holidays, everyone! Family's fine!
Jimbo Jones: Dude, you'd better see this.
Homer Simpson: (STRAINED) I'm fine.
Chief Wiggum: Attention, Brotherhood of the Spectacles: you are ordered to immediately evacuate the school, and then return to school where you belong.
Bart Simpson: I need to know that Chalmers will be taken care of!
Chief Wiggum: We don't negotiate with terrorists! Or the people that supply our uniforms and weapons. We just pay whatever they say.
Gary Chalmers: Let me talk to the boy!
Gary Chalmers: It's time for you to stand down, son. When I met you, you were nothing more than a thick file of infractions. Now I see a young man I'm proud to call my disciplinary problem.
Bart Simpson: (EMOTIONAL) Thanks. (THEN ALL BUSINESS) But these rough riders aren't dismounting until you get your job back.
Lou: What do you think, Chief? Can we take the building without hurtin' anybody?
Chief Wiggum: Well, if a group of Muppets can take Manhattan...
State Comptroller Atkins: Job restored!
Gary Chalmers: Increase in title?
State Comptroller Atkins: Fine. You're super-duperintendent.

Gary Chalmers: Our spies will go planet-side, locate said Hilarium and contact us so that we may begin extraction. This is a delicate mission that requires utter loyalty. I can think of no better candidate than the resentful guy in the wheelchair who has just arrived.

Lisa Simpson: People are loving our list of Springfield's top ninety-nine Afghan restaurants.
Bart Simpson: I feel bad for all those places that didn't make the cut.
Homer Simpson: All right, food nerds, reality check...
Homer Simpson: All the food in those pictures is poop by now. Minds blown, you're welcome.
Homer Simpson: I'll remind you kids what real fun is!
Krusty the Clown: Hey hey, kids! (LAUGHS) Krustyland has a new ride! The Eyeballs Of Death!
Krusty the Clown: It only passed the safety panel by a three to two vote! And that third vote didn't come cheap! (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: And I've got tickets for the grand opening Saturday night!
Lisa Simpson: Whoa! / Cool!
Marge Simpson: Uh, kids... don't forget about our special plans Saturday night.
Bart Simpson: Oh sorry, Dad. Our blog is so popular, we got an invitation to the most exclusive restaurant in town. Kent Brockman himself could only get a reservation at five-thirty or nine-thirty!
Lisa Simpson: (GIGGLES) It's called "El Chemistri" and they use science to make the food!
Spanish Chef: Behold... pine needle sorbet!
Marge Simpson: (DROOLING NOISES)
Homer Simpson: (STUNNED) Pine needle... sorbet... (LOSING IT) Pine needle sorbet!! My kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it "sherbert" and they wish it was ice cream!
Bart Simpson: Sorry, Dad -- this is our thing now.
Homer Simpson: Fine. Blow off "Fun Dad," go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs.
Marge Simpson: Don't be so jealous, Homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me.
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED NOISE) Jealous? Me?! (DESPERATE HAUGHTINESS) That is to laugh! The very idea... if anything (CRAZY LAUGH) you're the one who's jealous!
Marge Simpson: Of what?
Homer Simpson: (HEAVING SOBS) Of how much fun I am to be around! (SMALL SOB) It's always a party with (MASSIVE SOB) Fun Dad!
Homer Simpson: (SOBS) Too sad to walk! Too sad and fun to walk...
Marge Simpson: What are you doing?
Homer Simpson: (SULKY) When I'm sad, I make baseball bats.
Marge Simpson: Homie, I don't want you to feel excluded. Would you like to come with us to dinner at El Chemistri?
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) Really? You'd let me in on your thing? Even though I think it's stupid?
Marge Simpson: Of course.
Homer Simpson: (DELIGHTED) Hand me that saw, Marge!
Marge Simpson: Why?
Homer Simpson: When I'm happy, I make birdhouses!
Homer Simpson: Kids! Guess what? Mom invited me to your fancy dinner!

(MARGE'S DREAM: ext. marge's dream - SINGAPORE - street food market - night)
TONY BOURDAIN: I'm food bad-boy Tony Bourdain. There's nowhere I won't go and nothing I won't eat -- as long as I'm paid in emeralds and my hotel room has a bidet that shoots warm champagne.
TONY BOURDAIN: I'm here at a Singapore street-food market with famous blogging family, the Three Mouthketeers.
TONY BOURDAIN: Marge, you've got to try some of this "hang hir kuay chap."
Marge Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!

Marge Simpson: (SCARED NOISE) Gordon Ramsay!
Gordon Ramsay: You (BLEEP)-ed it up, big blue, didn't you? Why did you invite Homer? He stole your bloody thunder! You're not as (BLEEP)-ing fun as him, and you never will be!
Gordon Ramsay: Darling, darling, crying's not fun! Homer's fun! Now get out of my dream!
Marge Simpson: It's my dream!
Gordon Ramsay: Not any more it's not! Ramsay awake!

Homer Simpson: (SLEEP TALKING) Fun me... fun me... fun me...
Marge Simpson: (TENSE) Kids, I was thinking... was it really such a great idea to invite your father to that dinner?
Bart Simpson: Relax -- Dad will be the life of the party. He'll be the fourth Mouth-keteer.
Marge Simpson: But there weren't Four Musketeers...
Lisa Simpson: Yeah-huh: (QUICKLY) Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan.
Cletus Spuckler: Oh honey, I always liked yer home-cooked better anyways.
Marge Simpson: (LOSING IT) D'Artagnan wasn't a musketeer! He only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- (STRIDENT) which he lost!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear plant - homer's workstation - day)
Homer Simpson: You know, I'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. Maybe I'll like it.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - kitchen - Intercut)
Marge Simpson: (EDGY) Oh, I doubt it. You sit at communal tables, full of hipsters.
Homer Simpson: Well, actually, I've come around on hipsters. Takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat.
Marge Simpson: And the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. It's too crazy for you.
Homer Simpson: (OBLIVIOUS) So it's weird -- don't worry, I'll make it fun.
Marge Simpson: (CONCERNED) Yeah, you always do. Well, here's where to meet us...
Marge Simpson: 1501 W-- (CUTS HERSELF OFF, GETTING IDEA) East Oak Street.
Homer Simpson: East Oak Street, is that it?
Marge Simpson: Uhh... (MAKES DECISION) Yes! Yes! East Oak Street. That's where you should go. (FORCED UPBEAT) See ya there!

Homer Simpson: The experience begins!
Homer Simpson: (GETTING YANKED NOISE)
(REAL EL CHEMISTRI: EXT. REAL EL CHEMISTRI - CONTINUOUS - ESTABLISHING)
Bart Simpson: Where's Dad?
Marge Simpson: Um... I don't know. Probably changed his mind and stopped off for donuts. (AWKWARD LAUGH, THEN UNCOMFORTABLE NOISE)
Spanish Chef: Before you is a deconstructed Caesar salad: romaine lettuce gel, egg yolk ice, crouton foam and anchovy air. You eat it like this: (QUICKLY) gel-ice-foam-air-foam-ice-gel-foam-air.
(WRONG ADDRESS: inT. WRONG ADDRESS - 1501 EAST oak STREET - CONTinuous)
Homer Simpson: Just like Marge said -- chemicals and test tubes. (TO THUG) The open kitchen is a nice touch.

Homer Simpson: (DELIGHTED CHUCKLE) I'm doing this for my family!
(Meth Lab: int. meth lab - continuous)
Chief Wiggum: All right, breaking baddies, drop the meth!

(El Chemistri: INT. El ChemistrI - MEANWHILE)
Spanish Chef: And now... pork chops one hundred ways!
Bart Simpson: A hundred pork chops!
Lisa Simpson: I can't believe Dad is missing this!
Marge Simpson: Sure, your Dad's great, but I'm fun too -- look at me eat, huh! (GOBBLES FOOD, HOMER-LIKE EATING NOISES) D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!
Marge Simpson: Who am I kidding? I'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. (SIGHS) I'm calling Homer.
Homer Simpson: Marge! This isn't a food restaurant! It's a meth restaurant! A meth-taurant!
Homer Simpson: (SCARED SHRIEK)
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) Foodies, help me! My husband's in danger!
Amuse Bruce: (MOAN) We can't leave now. We haven't had the root vegetables cooked in the perfect vacuum of outer space!
Foie Greg: They say you can't even understand parsnips until you've had zero-g parsnips!
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Spanish Chef: How dare you walk out on me! (SUDDENLY NICE) Your dessert is in this doggie-bag woven from the silk of a blueberry-fed spider. (FURIOUS) Take it and go!
(Meth Lab: EXT. METH LAB - a little later)
Brandine Del Roy: Aw shucks, we get the family dressed up to go to our favorite meth lab, and it's all raided-out!

Young Thug: Merci Maman pour la tarte tatin à la mode...
Thug: (NOSTALGIC SIGH)
Thug: Oh Marge, you saved me from the danger you put me in... I am so happy and angry.
Thug: I'm sorry... I guess I just wanted the kids to look at me the way they look at you.
Homer Simpson: (SYMPATHETIC NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: Wow Mom, that was awesome!
Bart Simpson: We ate mad-scientist food and broke up a meth lab in the same day!
Bart Simpson: Fun Mom! Fun Mom! Fun Mom!
(Krustyland: ext. krustyland - day)
Homer Simpson: Now that's my kind of foam.

Paleontologist: Our journey begins sixty-five million years ago, when amazing creatures took their first steps...
Marge Simpson: It's so cute that all these children are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs!
Kids: (BUILDING TERRIFIED SCREAMS)
Milhouse Van Houten: These aren't dinosaurs -- dinosaurs sing!
Ralph Wiggum: (SCARED) I wanna go back in mommy!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (PAINED "BEING DRAGGED" NOISES) I paid eight-hundred dollars for five minutes.
Paleontologist: ... the dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions of years -- until a massive asteroid collided with the earth, bringing their reign to an end.
Homer Simpson: (CALLING FROM SEATS, COCKY, SING-SONG) Ex-tinct!
Homer Simpson: We're not here for you, we're here for Lenny.
Paleontologist: So remember, take good care of the earth, or we could suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs.
Marge Simpson: Ooo kids, did you hear that lesson?
Bart Simpson: How is that the lesson? The point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. So we should party hard and wreck the place.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?
Marge Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) What? They've got a point.
(OUTER CONCOURSE: INT. OUTER CONCOURSE - LATER)
Lisa Simpson: (EXCITED) Gift shop!
Homer Simpson: (FRUSTRATED GROAN, THEN) All right, you can each have one toy.
Bart Simpson: Lisa has a big toy! No fair! That means I get two small toys!
Lisa Simpson: No fair! This isn't big, it's medium!
Bart Simpson: No fair, then I get four small toys and Lisa gets one medium and one small.
Lisa Simpson: What?
Lisa Simpson: He gets four and I only get two?! No fair!
Homer Simpson: (LOSING IT) All right, that's it! Forget it! No toys for anyone!
Maggie Simpson: (ONE SAD SUCK)
Homer Simpson: (CRACKING) Okay -- Maggie gets a toy!

Homer Simpson: So tired... go on without me.
Homer Simpson: (SNORING NOISES)
(Changing Room: int. changing room - continuous)
Lisa Simpson: You're T.R. Francis! You wrote the Angelica Button books! They're my favorite fantasy novels!
T.R. Francis: (BRITISH) Um... Yes, it's me, the creator of your beloved magical world! Full of whimsy and... (SEARCHING) chapters... Now off you go! Bye-bye now!
Seymour Skinner: And they're set at a place kids relate to. Say, a school.
Lisa Simpson: (RAPIDLY) But why are you working at a dinosaur show? And why did you run away from me? And how did Angelica get a new wand after Baron Mortdeath burned the Wandwood Forest? And--
T.R. Francis: (CUTS HER OFF, DROPS ENGLISH ACCENT) Look, you seem like a smart kid, so here's the truth: T.R. Francis isn't real.
Lisa Simpson: (IN DISBELIEF) Of course you're real! (READS UNDER AUTHOR PHOTO) Everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus. How could that be made up?!
T.R. Francis: I'm just an actress they used for the jacket photo. That "inspirational life story" is pure fiction. Oh, I hate to break it to you...
(CORPORATE SKYSCRAPER: EXT. CORPORATE SKYSCRAPER - DAY)
T.R. Francis: ...but all the books you kids love are conceived in executive boardrooms...The plots are based on market research...
(Skyscraper: Int. skyscraper - office - rows of cubicles - day)
T.R. Francis: ...and the pages are churned out by a room full of pill-popping lit majors desperate for work.
(Bookaccino's: ext. bookaccino's - night)
T.R. Francis: Publishers rake in the cash and unsuspecting kids get ten books a year by their favorite "author."
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) Everything I believed about young adult literature is a lie!
Homer Simpson: It's not against the law to sleep in a Tyrannosaurus head!
Wiseguy: Sir, you're inside an Allosaurus.
Homer Simpson: I demand to speak to my paleontologist!
(Simpson Kitchen: INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: Can I have my allowance early? I need to buy some carbon-offset credits so I can burn all my Angelica Button books.
Marge Simpson: Oh honey, I'm sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur. But you liked the stories when you read them, so what does it matter?
Lisa Simpson: Doesn't it bother you that Betty Crocker is an invention of twenties-era ad men?
Marge Simpson: (TIGHTLY) I know you're hurting, but that's no reason to lash out at me.
Lisa Simpson: Can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
Homer Simpson: (INTRIGUED) A million bucks?
Lisa Simpson: Every book on the "Young Adult" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) I know five idiots!
Lisa Simpson: And they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! It's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
Homer Simpson: (RUBBING CHIN) The perfect crime, eh?
(Noiseland Arcade: EXT. NOISELAND VIDEO ARCADE - DAY - ESTABLISHING)
Bart Simpson: (NOT TURNING) Whatever the job is, I'm not interested.
Homer Simpson: A million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
Bart Simpson: I like the beat -- play me the tune.
Homer Simpson: We're taking down kids who read.
Bart Simpson: Chapter-book crowd? That's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?
Homer Simpson: I'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.
Bart Simpson: Tween-lit gang-write?
Homer Simpson: Tween-lit gang-write. But this Babar needs a Zephyr.
Bart Simpson: A Zephyr?
Homer Simpson: You're the Zephyr.
Bart Simpson: This better not turn out like Kansas City.
Homer Simpson: It won't be like Kansas City.
(Skinner Home: ext. PRINCIPAL skinner's house - day)
Bart Simpson: Come on, Skinner, you're the best kid-man in the business. You've read their notes, searched their lockers -- you know how tweens think.
Seymour Skinner: No thanks, gentlemen, I've got a nice quiet life here, and I mean to keep it that way.
Agnes Skinner: Your friends are lookin' at my bloomers -- wash 'em again!
Bart Simpson: With your share of the money, you could get your own studio apartment...
Seymour Skinner: (LOST IN REVERIE) The refrigerator could have my magnets on it.
Seymour Skinner: I'm in.
Homer Simpson: (CHARMING) Come on beautiful, I can't do the job without you, so what do you say?
(Patty and Selma's Apartment: int. SELMA and Patty's apartment - day)
Bart Simpson: Our crew needs you, Bouvier. You've read enough fantasy novels to choke a Hippogriff!

Moe Szyslak: (DESPERATE) Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want in! What does your crew need? A safecracker? A wheel man?
Homer Simpson: The caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.
Moe Szyslak: (SHEEPISH) Well, I don't like to brag about it, but I did publish five modestly successful children's books.
Bart Simpson: All we need now is a computer guy...
(House: ext. house - day)

Professor Jonathan Frink: (CLEARING THROAT) Uh, yes.
Homer Simpson: You're in.
Professor Jonathan Frink: In what?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's room - day)
Bart Simpson: I keep going over the job from every angle, but I can't shake the feeling that we're missing something.
Homer Simpson: Relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville.
Lisa Simpson: You're group-writing a book?! But the only reason anyone would ever do that is... (SHOCKED GASP) profit!
Bart Simpson: Like no one ever writes for money, Lisa. I don't see your boyfriend William Shakespeare missing too many meals.
Lisa Simpson: I'll show you! (THINKS) I'll write a book myself! A personal story my readers will connect with!
Homer Simpson: Wait, you're gonna be all the guys? How would that work?
Lisa Simpson: (AGGRAVATED GROAN)
(Lisa's Bedroom: INT. LISA'S ROOM - continuous)
Lisa Simpson: This is how real writers do it. I'll just bang out two thousand words and then I'll stop, even if I'm on fire. I gotta pace myself. (TYPES) "Chapter one." (BEAT) Wait, I can't start without music to inspire me.
Lisa Simpson: Why is Bach next to Muddy Waters? That's my problem -- I gotta get these CDs organized!
Lisa Simpson: There, finished. Now if I win just two more games of online Boggle, I'll be ready to start writing.

Patty Bouvier: The heroes are all orphans...
Seymour Skinner: But it's actually magic!
Professor Jonathan Frink: And the protagonist always discovers that he is supernatural!
Homer Simpson: (PUTTING IT TOGETHER) Okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!
Patty Bouvier: Vampires... like these?
Gang: (DISAPPOINTED NOISES)
Professor Jonathan Frink: So many vampires! With the fangs and the capes and the medals nobody knows how they earned them!
Moe Szyslak: (PANICKY) Hey, this job's fallin' apart! Everyone head for a different airport and we meet in Rio in a year with new faces!
Bart Simpson: No one's goin' anywhere. (CALM) Okay, the vampire genre is sucked out. All we gotta do is find a new monster to be our hero.
Kids: (SCARED SCREAMS) A troll!
Moe Szyslak: Hey, I ain't a troll. Look, I bleed red just like you.
Moe Szyslak: The first part is always green, but it turns red.
Bart Simpson: A troll, that's it! Our book could be about an orphan troll!
Seymour Skinner: Trolls live under bridges -- the school should be under a bridge! The Brooklyn Bridge!
Patty Bouvier: And the cool kids are elves, the cheerleaders are pixies, the stoners are... (SNAPS FINGERS) gargoyles!
Professor Jonathan Frink: And they play a complicated sport which makes no sense called Fuzzlepitch!
Moe Szyslak: (EXCITED) Yeah, that's good!
Patty Bouvier: (EXCITED) We've cracked it!
Patty Bouvier: (EXCITED) We're gonna be rich!
Man: (BRITISH ACCENT) Pardon me, but are you scheming to coauthor a successful series of children's fantasy novels?
Moe Szyslak: Okay Stonehenge, let's see how good you are at eavesdroppin' without a throat!
Patty Bouvier: Don't kill him! That's Neil Gaiman!
Moe Szyslak: I don't care if he's the guy who wrote "Sandman Volume One: Preludes And Nocturnes," no one spies on us!
Neil Gaiman: Perhaps someone of my experience would be a valuable addition to your "crew."
Homer Simpson: The king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
Bart Simpson: Okay, Gaiman, you're in. Your job is to get lunch. And lose the British accent.
Neil Gaiman: (EXAGGERATED AMERICAN ACCENT) Cheeseburgers, French fries -- I'm all over that, pal!
Homer Simpson: But why?
Lisa Simpson: Sitting in a coffee shop -- I couldn't feel more like a real writer! (CONTENTED SIGH, BEAT) Oh, Better set up my wi-fi in case I need to do some research! (CONSIDERS) But if I'm gonna use their free internet, I really should buy something.

Bart Simpson: But Lis, when this book comes out, you'll be beloved! Not just by Milhouses, you'll get attention from Jacksons, Xanders -- even Aidens!
Lisa Simpson: (DREAMY) Aww, I've always wanted an Aiden...
Seymour Skinner: Here it is: an advance copy.
Patty Bouvier: "The Vampire Twins Of Transylvania Prep?!" Where's the trolls?
Professor Jonathan Frink: The trolls are now vampires, the Brooklyn Bridge is now a castle, and Fuzzlepitch is now Bloodball! Oh! Weak! Weak! And lame!
Homer Simpson: How could the publishers change our book? If they had been in charge of the Sistine Chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!
(SLICK PUBLISHER'S OFFICE: int. slick publisher's office - Day)
Slick Publisher: Look, we market-tested the book, and it really got dinged on the whole "trolls" thing. I mean dinged! So we made some changes. Don't feel bad. Before we got our hands on "Twilight," it was about a girl who fell in love with a golem.
Slick Publisher: But teenagers weren't going to spend their allowances to join Team Schmul.
Homer Simpson: But the trolls were the best part! Do the characters still say "troll-y" instead of "cool?"
Slick Publisher: No.
Homer Simpson: Oh, that is so untroll-y!
Slick Publisher: Hey, if you don't want your words changed, write a screenplay. We own your book -- so why don't you go and cry into your million-dollar check.
Patty Bouvier: How could they do this to our book?
Seymour Skinner: (HURT) It was the singular vision of seven people.
Neil Gaiman: What you're feeling is called "pride of authorship." You thought you only cared about money, but you actually care more about what you've created together.
Homer Simpson: British Fonzie is right. Our story is actually more important... than money.
Patty Bouvier: I was gonna buy the apartment next door and fill it with dolls, but now that just sounds stupid!
Seymour Skinner: They can't do this to us -- we've gotta fight back!
Gang: Yeah! / Let's get 'em! / Oh yes! / He's right!
Bart Simpson: Rule number one of book heists: "never fall in love with the book." We queer the deal -- we lose the money!
Seymour Skinner: Bart, remember the thousand-year war between the trolls and the ogres?
Bart Simpson: Yeah?
Seymour Skinner: (GRIMLY) Now it's a dance contest at the vampire prom.
Bart Simpson: Let's steal back our book.
(LITERARY TOWERS: EXT. LITERARY TOWERS - NIGHT)
Homer Simpson: Somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.
Bart Simpson: The book prints at midnight. So if we swap in the original version (HOLDS UP FLASH DRIVE), they'll print the wrong book -- our book.
Patty Bouvier: And before the publishers can do anything about it, "The Troll Twins Of Underbridge Academy" will be in every bookstore in America!
Seymour Skinner: (INSPIRING) This is the Fuzzlepitch Finals, and tonight, we drink from the Wazzle Cup!
(LITERARY TOWERS LOBBY: INT. literary towers LOBBY - LATER)
Seymour Skinner: Hello, I'm the pizza delivery man.
Guard: We didn't order a pizza.
Seymour Skinner: No, of course you didn't. The establishment I work for delivers pizzas to everyone, and then gives the customer the option of accepting or refusing delivery.
Guard: That's a terrible business strategy.
Seymour Skinner: No, no, it's quite sound.
Guard: Okay, fine. Where's the pizza?
Seymour Skinner: Pizza?
(PRINTING ROOM FLOOR: int. printing room floor - NIGHT)
Bart Simpson: The central computer is through here. (HOLDS UP FLASH DRIVE) All we have to do is upload our file and--
Slick Publisher: Good evening, gentlemen.
Bart Simpson: (SHAKING HEAD) Kansas City.
Homer Simpson: (SHAKING HEAD) Kansas City.
Slick Publisher: So, you thought you would un-ruin your book. If it's any consolation, you never had a chance.
Homer Simpson: Woo-hoo! All right!
Slick Publisher: Someone in your gang tipped me off to your little caper.
Bart Simpson: A traitor?
Moe Szyslak: I bet it's the Earl of Marmalade over here.
Neil Gaiman: (TERRIFIED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: No, guys... it was me.
Gang: (SHOCKED GASP) / It can't be! / Oh betrayal!
Patty Bouvier: It's always a dame.
Lisa Simpson: My name is finally on a book!
Lisa Simpson: (EXCITED) And they're letting me write the sequel! (RATIONALIZING) A hard deadline is just the kick in the pants I need to focus and get some serious writing done!
Slick Publisher: Now to enter the password and to authorize final publication. (TYPING) My favorite theme of wall calendars...
Slick Publisher: Lisa, would you care to do the honors?
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry.
Slick Publisher: Oh, by the way, the audio book is only available... abridged! Abridged!!! (EVIL LAUGH)
(Springfield: EXT. SPRINGFIELD - DAWN)
Homer Simpson: Well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something.
Bart Simpson: Our book! The real one!
Gang: (SURPRISED GASP) / Yes! / Wonderful words!
Lisa Simpson: No need to thank me, boys.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you.
Lisa Simpson: You could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password...
Lisa Simpson: So I pretended to betray you... then after he typed the password...
Lisa Simpson: I secretly switched the flash drives.
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED) You switched the drives?
Lisa Simpson: I got the idea from every movie ever made.
(BOOKACCINOS: int. bookacCinos - day - a little later)
Lisa Simpson: And the best part is, my face is still on the back flap.
Lisa Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP)
Lisa Simpson: (ENRAGED) Gaiman!
Neil Gaiman: Poor Lisa, did it never occur to her that there might be three flash drives?
Neil Gaiman: I've heisted my way to the bestseller list once again. And the most brilliant part is... I don't even know how to read. (EVIL LAUGH)
Moe Szyslak: Gaiman, I've been waitin' to do this for a long time.
Moe Szyslak: Congratulations, partner! We did it.
Moe Szyslak: Neil, how come you watched me drink mine but didn't drink yours?
Neil Gaiman: It's simple, Moe. I don't like the taste... of poison.
Moe Szyslak: Awwww... crap.
(Krustylu Studios: int. krustylu studios - stage - day)
Bart Simpson: Is there any better feeling than waiting for a live Krusty show to start?
Milhouse Van Houten: Maybe watching your bride coming down the aisle.
Bart Simpson: (THOUGHTFUL) Hmmm.
Zombie Bride: (ZOMBIE NOISE)
Thought Bubble Homer: (A LITTLE CHOKED-UP) Why does she get to eat before the reception? (CRYING)
Sideshow Mel: Seltzer bottle connected and pressurized?
Krusty the Clown: Check.
Sideshow Mel: Roll-up dicky set to six?
Krusty the Clown: Nope. Eleven!
Sideshow Mel: (GASPS)
Krusty the Clown: My comedy comes from taking risks! Or avoiding them, I can't remember.
Female Marketing Executive: Krusty, we need to talk.
Krusty the Clown: Make it fast. I've got a coiled up spring ready to boi-oi-oi-oi-oing. (MOANS) Why can't I be funny with just my words? Bill Maher doesn't put dangerous things near his crotch except when he's off work.
Male Marketing Executive: (MILD CHUCKLE, THEN:) It's about your vodka, "Absolut Krusty."
Female Marketing Executive: We're having trouble persuading people it's hip to drink a vodka made by a clown, in a bottle shaped like a clown, that does this when you open it...
Krusty the Clown: (CHUCKLES) Always gets me.
Male Marketing Executive: Yeah, plus that TV special where you drank another brand of vodka didn't help.
Krusty the Clown: I used up my stuff poisoning deer!
Male Marketing Executive: If we're ever gonna sell your vodka, we need to do something completely unorthodox: a viral marketing campaign.
Krusty the Clown: Get to the point! Unless you want a face full of clown chunks!
Male Marketing Executive: People are more likely to drink your vodka if they think all their coolest friends are drinking it.
Female Marketing Executive: So we pay for a big party at the home of a Springfield trendsetter.
Male Marketing Executive: ...your Brockman, your Bumblebee Man...
Female Marketing Executive: He invites his cool friends, we serve free cocktails, made with your vodka, generating buzz.
Krusty the Clown: We've got buzz.
Female Marketing Executive: Positive buzz.
Krusty the Clown: (STUNNED) That exists? Wow.
Lenny Leonard: Boy, everyone from the nuclear plant is here. Except the bosses, of course.
Female Marketing Executive: So all you have to do is find one of your loyal fans whose house we can trash and friends you can exploit.
Krusty the Clown: (ANGUISHED NOISE) I need a drink.
Krusty the Clown: Not that! Never that!
Krusty the Clown: Hey, hey kids! Who wants to host a viral marketing event?
Kids: (THUNDEROUS CHEER)
Krusty the Clown: All you have to do is write me a letter about how hip and influential your parents are.
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, I'm gonna win that thing.
Milhouse Van Houten: How do you know, Bart? Maybe for once I'll win.
Krusty the Clown: Children of troubled marriages not eligible.
Milhouse Van Houten: (ANGUISHED NOISE)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - a week later - establishing)
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED) So... why are you here? (WORRIED) Is it about that unauthorized Krusty lookalike I hired for Lisa's first communion? What was his name?
Lisa Simpson: Krappy the Klunk.
Lisa Simpson: See?
Female Marketing Executive: Homer, we're here to throw the most redonkulous marketing outreach this town's ever seen. All you have to do is invite every cool person you know.
Bart Simpson: Hey, I wrote the application. Do any of my friends get to come?
Male Marketing Executive: One friend. He can listen to music with headphones on, he gets one slice of cheese pizza, and if the party gets slow, he has to pretend to let Krusty save him from drowning.
Female Marketing Executive: Redonkulous!
Male Marketing Executive: Off the dilge!
(Simpson Home: EXt. simpsons house - evening - establishing)
Homer Simpson: This party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan. (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: I hope Bart's having fun.
Sideshow Mel: And that's why John Gielgud is more of a father to me than my own father!
Bart Simpson: Where's the nachos you promised?
Sideshow Mel: There'll be time enough for nachos!
Kirk Van Houten: Why can't I go to the grownup room?
Sideshow Mel: You said the clown scared you.
Kirk Van Houten: Well he did a little.
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpsons Living room - continuous)
Carl Carlson: Yeah, even Homer's not dumb enough to invite...
C. Montgomery Burns: This is the famous "party."
C. Montgomery Burns: Feh. Guh. (RE: LENNY AND CARL) Pffoy.
Female Marketing Executive: He's destroying our youthful demographic!
Krusty the Clown: Oh God, I need a drink!
Krusty the Clown: ...so the car in front of us forgot to validate his... (SEES BURNS) um...
C. Montgomery Burns: (AWKWARDLY INTERRUPTING) I was in an anecdote once!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Um, I have surgery in the morning.
Worker: Yeah and... I'm the one having the surgery.
Female Marketing Executive: Homer, you're the nominal host! Do something!
Homer Simpson: (PANICKY NOISES)
Homer Simpson: (INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY) Mr. Burns, so glad you're here! Finally the party can get started!
C. Montgomery Burns: (GRUMPY) Your cotillion seems to be in full promenade.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Good one... uh... Mr. Burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke.
Homer Simpson: C'mon, just pick a popular song.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO OPERATOR) Do you have anything by Prince... Wilhelm of Prussia?
Karaoke Operator: (WISEGUY) I have sixteen million songs, but, uh, no.
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO) Just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog.
Karaoke Operator: Let me check my beeswax cylinders.
Karaoke Operator: (TAKING ONE CYLINDER) Ah, here we are...
(Simpson Home: int. simpsons house - lateR)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SINGING) COME JOSEPHINE IN MY FLYING MACHINE!
Homer Simpson: GOING UP SHE GOES! UP SHE GOES!
C. Montgomery Burns: BALANCE YOURSELF LIKE A BIRD ON A BEAM
Crowd: IN THE AIR SHE GOES! THERE SHE GOES!
C. Montgomery Burns: (FLATTERED GIGGLE) May you all fly in an aero-plane someday.
Waylon Smithers: You certainly seem to be enjoying yourself, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Indeed. That Homer Simpson is the beating baboon heart of this party.
Homer Simpson: (TO CLETUS) ...So he says, "Bigamy is having one too many wives." (TO HIBBERT) To which I replied, "So's monogamy."
Cletus Spuckler: (CHUCKLE) / Yeah!
C. Montgomery Burns: I may have a use for this Simpson character higher up in the organization.
Marge Simpson: Welcome home, handsome! (LONG SEXY SMOOCH)
Waylon Smithers: Really? Well... as safety inspector he hasn't exactly set the world on fire. Although he came close several times.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: ext. nuclear plant - day - establishing)
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, you're probably wondering why you're here.
Homer Simpson: It's never good. I always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet...
C. Montgomery Burns: When I made you a hoop you split your pants! Now here at the plant there's no position more important than our accounts man, who's responsible for glad-handing our customers and suppliers. I'd like you to take over that position.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) The last thing I understood in that was "pants."
C. Montgomery Burns: Just give me your answer! And make it quick! Our current "account man," Robert Marlowe here, is retiring at the end of the month.
Robert Marlowe: In two weeks the only tie I'll be wearing is for autoerotic pleasure.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes. Simpson, only you have the bonhomie and rotund charm to replace him. (ENTICING) It means a hefty expense account and a corner office.
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Well, in that case...
Robert Marlowe: Before you say yes, Simpson, I feel it's my duty to warn you... (SERIOUS) ...account men lose their soul.
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! No more church!
Homer Simpson: So long, Sector 7-G...hello, Sector 22-F!

Robert Marlowe: The higher they rise, the further they fall!
Homer Simpson: You know, you're kind of a downer.
Homer Simpson: I thought you were retiring. Why are you still here?
Robert Marlowe: Hey, you're a baby account man. Still on the bottle. (SHAKES WHISKEY BOTTLE) So for my last good deed before I retire, I'm gonna help you persuade Mayor Quimby to sign off on a nuclear rate hike.
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Uh-oh, a meeting with the Mayor. How do I prepare for that?
Homer Simpson: (KNOWING CHUCKLE) I see. (DRAINS GLASS) Now, how do I prepare for the meeting with the Mayor?
Homer Simpson: (A LITTLE TIPSY) I am really enjoying this, but, um... (DOWN TO BUSINESS) Hello! Meeting with the Mayor?
Homer Simpson: (TIPSIER) Awww... bourbon go bye-bye.
Robert Marlowe: There ain't enough bourbon in Kentucky for you, big guy.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect.
(The Loin King: ext. "THE LOIN KING" restaurant - evening)
(Chophouse: int. chophouse - continuous)

Mayor Joe Quimby: Much obliged. Now, ah, where would you uh like to discuss your proposed tax breaks?
Carl Carlson: (THROUGH WINDOW) Hey Homer! / Look at you, man!
Homer Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) I've outgrown you!
Homer Simpson: (TO MAYOR, HAUGHTILY) Ah, Mr. Mayor! More peanut nore?
Carl Carlson: (TO LENNY) Say what you will, man, he's pretty resourceful.

Robert Marlowe: And if you don't like the score you can change it yourself.
Homer Simpson: Bo-ring.
Homer Simpson: (THRILLED) God, what a great game! And you too can be on the winning team, Mr. Mayor. The Springfield Nuclear Team.
Mayor Joe Quimby: (IMPRESSED) I have never heard an analogy involving sports! I love it!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear plant - homer's corner office - day)
Homer Simpson: I can't believe that was work!
Robert Marlowe: Yeah, but work is over now. Wanna drink with me till I fall asleep?
Homer Simpson: (TORN) Oh, well...
Homer Simpson: I really should look at this picture a little longer.
Homer Simpson: (GRABBING COAT) Okay, let's go.
Robert Marlowe: Great. Now in honor of my last day on the hamster wheel, I have a little gift for you.
Robert Marlowe: This set of bar tools has been passed down from account man to account man since the dawn of history... 1956.
Homer Simpson: (TEARFUL) Can you be my dad?
Robert Marlowe: If your mom was a secretary there's a good chance I am.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpsons house - several nights later - late evening)
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) It's a rat race, but it looks like I won.
Marge Simpson: (FLIRTY) To the victor go the spoils.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story.
Homer Simpson: Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you.
Bart Simpson: (SCORNFUL) Read to Lisa? Why don't you just ask me to kiss her?
Marge Simpson: If you kissed her that would be lovely.
Bart Simpson: (PANICKY) I'll read! I'll read!
Homer Simpson: (STERNLY) And kiss.
Lisa Simpson: Does anybody want my opinion?
Homer Simpson: Please, Lisa. I had eighteen martinis today.
Marge Simpson: (SEXY) Hel-lo.

Lisa Simpson: (LOOKING AT BOOK) Genius.
Bart Simpson: ...is eternal pati... pat-eh... pa-tie...
Lisa Simpson: (LOOKING AT BOOK) Patience! Patience! Get on with it!
Bart Simpson: Shut up! Shut up! I'm a bad reader, okay?!
Lisa Simpson: Well, I could help you...
Bart Simpson: I don't want your help! I'll get one of those jobs where you don't need to read, like French fry maker or general.
Lisa Simpson: Well, you're getting my help.
Bart Simpson: Forget it.
Lisa Simpson: Don't you want to be able to read the things people carve into your chest in prison?
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) I guess.
Homer Simpson: Close enough.
(Simpson Home: int. simpsons house - lisa's bedroom - night)
Bart Simpson: "But when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very hard to keep."
Lisa Simpson: We did it, Bart! (HUGS BART) I'm a mentor!
Bart Simpson: Big deal. You taught me to read one book.
Lisa Simpson: No Bart! You can read other books too!
Bart Simpson: (SHOCKED) What?!
Marge Simpson: Homie, what are you doing?
Homer Simpson: My work is so meaningless.
Marge Simpson: You make electricity. It runs the hospital!
Homer Simpson: You can't touch electricity, Marge. You can't feel it.
Marge Simpson: That's because it would kill you.
Homer Simpson: (EMOTIONLESS) It already is killing me, Marge. (RATTLES HIS ICE) You're the only one I can talk to. My wife just doesn't get it.
Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED) I'm your wife.
Homer Simpson: My job is my wife. Loneliness, my mistress. Despair, my sex buddy. Angst is a chick I met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy.
Marge Simpson: I'm going to bed.
Homer Simpson: You don't understand me. (POINTS) Only she understands me.
Homer Simpson: Another round, kid?
Homer Simpson: Uh... I got here after you did.

Marge Simpson: ...but my husband's acting pretty odd. Coming home late. Drinking in the morning.
Robert Marlowe: Wake me when you get to "odd."
Marge Simpson: I don't suppose you'd consider taking your old job back so Homie can go back to his old job?
Robert Marlowe: Sorry, Marge. That account job hollowed me out like a cheap chocolate bunny. I've been divorced three times, I've got a cocktail addiction, a shrimp cocktail addiction, and I can't stop bending women to my sexual will.
Marge Simpson: Well, you certainly won't be bending me-- (LOOKING AROUND) Wait, how did I end up in your bedroom?
Robert Marlowe: Lady, I am smoother than an Eisenhower-era freeway.
Marge Simpson: Look, I came to talk about my husband, and... (LOOKS AROUND) How did we get in here?
Robert Marlowe: I think better in the shower. (ENTICING) There's room in here for two.
Marge Simpson: I'm a happily married woman!
Robert Marlowe: Wow, no woman's ever done that to me before. Your husband is a lucky man.
Marge Simpson: I know! And I don't want him to stray from anything except his diet. And I don't really want him to do that.
Marge Simpson: See? Luckiest man in the world.
Robert Marlowe: Marge, I made a big mistake years ago -- I gave up on my family. Then I gave up on my secret other family. I missed my son's graduation, my father's funeral and my dog's best in show. Don't let Homer make the mistakes I did.
Marge Simpson: (STARTLED) Luann?
Luann Van Houten: It's not what you think.
Kirk Van Houten: (ENTERING) It's much weirder.

Jimbo Jones: "Little Women?" Are you aware that's another way of saying "girls?"
Bart Simpson: Look, I had to read it to my sister.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Well maybe we should hear a little.
DOLPH: And then maybe you'll be hearing from my sisters. (BRANDISHES FISTS)
Jimbo Jones: Your fists are sisters?
DOLPH: Yeah. Poke-ahontas and Sock-ajawea!
Bart Simpson: Nice save.
DOLPH: Get reading!
Bart Simpson: "...and Amy and Jo hugged one another close, and everything was forgotten in one hearty kiss." End of chapter eight.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: You can't stop now! I want to know if their father comes home.
DOLPH: Does Jo learn to handle her hasty temper?
Jimbo Jones: Does Amy get over her conceitedness?
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on, guys, it's getting dark.
Jimbo Jones: Okay. But you better be here tomorrow after school.
DOLPH: 'Cause we're gonna keep making you read us a lame old girl's book!
Bullies: (EVIL CHUCKLE)
DOLPH: Bart needs to work on differentiating the character voices a little better.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: I know! I keep going "why is Meg saying that," and then I realize it's Beth.
Jimbo Jones: (AGREEING NOISES) / That's right.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear plant - Homer's office - later)

Dottie: This is a whisper-amplifying intercom!
Homer Simpson: (Short scream)
Marge Simpson: (URGENT) Homer, I want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation.
Homer Simpson: Of course, of course. Family is everything to us company men. Now, where shall we go on your vacation?
Marge Simpson: The farthest thing from this office I know: rafting down Rattler River Canyon.
Homer Simpson: That's great, let me run the numbers because I really want the Simpson account. And give these cigars to your children.
Marge Simpson: Don't talk to me like I'm a client!
Homer Simpson: You're not a client. You're the client.
Marge Simpson: (GROWLS)
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson! Put on your charm-their-pants-off pants! The mumpish oafs in Washington are sending their sternest band of nuclear regulators, handpicked to resist all blandishment.
Homer Simpson: I'll handle it. I always do.
C. Montgomery Burns: Rafting, eh? It's a perfect way to entertain them. Finally, humanity has found a use for water.
Homer Simpson: Mr. Burns, I can't go rafting with you because-- (TO SELF) wait a minute, could this all work?
Homer Simpson: Oh no you don't.
Ned Flanders: Coggily-doggily.
Homer Simpson: It all fits. Mr. Burns, rafting it is.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.
Dottie: But Mr. S... you just promised this week to Mrs. S, Master B., and Mamselles L. and M.!
Homer Simpson: Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me.
(Rattler River Canyon: Ext. RATTLER RIVER CANYON - day)

Marge Simpson: (SEXY) And maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
Homer Simpson: Not sure what you're going for, but (BOB HOPE GROWL)
Homer Simpson: Uh... Marge, why don't I catch us some salmon?
C. Montgomery Burns: It's about time. We've been making small talk about Mussolini for fifteen minutes.
Homer Simpson: Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in.
Homer Simpson: (MANY EXAGGERATED CONTACT SCREWING-IN SQUEAKS, THEN:) So, everybody good?
Regulator: Why did you get us "Diversity Kittens on Melting Pot Mountain?"
Diversity Kitten: It's more fun to play with a ball of yarn if it has all the colors in it.
Wheelchair Kitten: And yarn should be allowed to marry dental floss!
Homer Simpson: Uh-oh. If you've got that, then...

Marge Simpson: Homer! Are you... schmoozing those men?
Homer Simpson: (ALARMED SHRIEK)
Lisa Simpson: Um, I think we're supposed to get off here.
C. Montgomery Burns: Take us out first! Anyone can start a family! These days, no one can find a job!
Homer Simpson: Let's see, my family gives me love and sex. My work gives me money and sleep...
Lisa Simpson: Hurry! We're heading for the falls!
Homer Simpson: My co-workers are like a family. But in some ways my family is like a family too...
Marge Simpson: For God's sakes, Homer! I've given you three children!
Homer Simpson: (ANGUISHED) Whose side are you on?
Marge Simpson: Yours, Homie. I'm always on yours.
C. Montgomery Burns: How ironic. I survived the Titanic by making a raft out of steerage passengers and now this!
Robert Marlowe: Mr. Burns, your heart will go on!
C. Montgomery Burns: Marlowe? I thought you retired!
Robert Marlowe: I can't! Treasury Bills are paying nothing! Nothing!
(Riverbank: Ext. riverbank - a little later)
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, Simpson, you were willing to let me go over a waterfall, but you cut operating expenses by six percent, so you're forgiven.
Homer Simpson: Thanks. (RISING) Now if you'll excuse me, I don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old Simpson family fun.
Homer Simpson: Hey kids, I'm it!
Homer Simpson: (DISTANT) I'm okay! And I found some gold!
Marge Simpson: Oh, I'm so glad you're not an Accounts Man anymore.
Homer Simpson: Yep, your worries are over. I'm back to being a boring old Safety Inspector at a nuclear power plant.

Lisa Simpson: Why can't we visit a real museum? One that doesn't have the skeletons of the Three Stooges in the lobby?
Marge Simpson: We have to see the Museum of TV before next Wednesday when it closes forever.

Marge Simpson: Isn't that just a rip-off of "The Honeymooners?"
Homer Simpson: Everything's a rip-off of "The Honeymooners." (À LA "HONEYMOONERS") Margie, you're the greatest.
Marge Simpson: Oh Ralph, Fred, Archie, King of Queens, I mean Homer.
Fatso: (RALPH KRAMDEN) You'll see, Eunice! I'm gonna win the Irish Sweepstakes, and then I'm buying you a mink coat.
Eunice: (EXAGGERATED BREATHING NOISES)
Fatso: Are you getting excited?
Eunice: (ALICE KRAMDEN) No, that's me not holding my breath!

Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) They were so childless and miserable.
Annie Crawford: (NOSTALGIC) The size forty-eights. That's when he was the funniest.
Homer Simpson: How would you know?
Annie Crawford: I was Fatso's agent.
Annie Crawford: Annie Dubinsky.
Annie Crawford: (EXTENDING HER HAND) If you ever hear a star's name and wonder "is he dead?" The answer is either I represent him, or "yes."
Homer Simpson: Now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?
Annie Crawford: (CONSIDERING NOISE) Would you play a bloated corpse on "CSI?"
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) Would I!
Annie Crawford: Wow, that's good bloat work.

Krusty the Clown: You're killing me here with this Catchy and Patchy. I'm barely on my own show!
Young Executive: Today's kids are uncomfortable with a clown whose every reference they have to look up on Wikipedia.
Krusty the Clown: Wikipedia, Twitter... who names these things? Percy Dovetonsils? (NERVOUS LAUGH) Get it? (PETERING OUT) Come on, he was on... Ernie Kovacs... with a smoking jacket...
Woman Executive: Krusty... we want to make some changes.
Krusty the Clown: (SUSPICIOUS) What kind of changes?

Krusty the Clown: (DEFIANT) Oh, no. My contract states there's only one way you're allowed to fire me.

Ron Rabinowitz: Krustila... I'm gonna drop you as a friend first, so that when I drop you as a client, you'll know it's only business.
Krusty the Clown: But we shared everything. Boats, girlfriends, condos. And when I finished, every one of 'em was spic and span.
Ron Rabinowitz: Krusty, I'm gonna prove that it's over.
Krusty the Clown: What? I'm on your garage door opener?

Krusty the Clown: (SOBS)
Lisa Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP) Krusty?
Krusty the Clown: (SOBS) Fate is so cruel. This morning I was a star, with a top agent. Now I'm strung out in a ball pit. (SOBS) Go Away! No kid should see his hero sunk so low.
Lisa Simpson: Well, you're not exactly my hero. I see you more as a cautionary tale.
Krusty the Clown: (ANGRY) What?! I'll show you who's a cautionary tale!
Krusty the Clown: (MUFFLED) I'll show everybody...!

Krusty the Clown: (SIGHS) I don't know if I've got it in me.
Bart Simpson: Well, people also love a quitter... Sarah Palin... The Beatles...
Krusty the Clown: Eh, it's hopeless without an agent.
Lisa Simpson: You need an agent? We met a ten percenter today. She'll get you meetings with the eye, the peacock, the alphabet web. You'll have a skein on the sked before you can say "Krusty's wardrobe furnished by Ha-Has of Beverly Hills".
Krusty the Clown: (BRIGHTENING) A new agent? I better freshen up.
Krusty the Clown: (HUMMING) Also better get back on those anti-psychotic meds.

Adult Bart: Wha'd-she-do?
Annie Crawford: But mark my words: the bohemian crowd is small potatoes. You're gonna have to broaden your act if you want to play in Peoria.
Annie Crawford: I mean, if you wanna hit it big, you've gotta lose this...stick this on...and make your comedy a touch more physical.
Annie Crawford: Like so.
Annie Crawford: (CHUCKLES) Herschel, you're gonna get everything you want: money and women and--

Marge Simpson: This is the part where I get the kids out of the room.

Annie Crawford: You ungrateful pig! I made you!
Krusty the Clown: Deep down I'm doing this to get back at my father.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: (LEANING OUT OF WINDOW) Don't blame this on me! Your childhood was heaven!
Annie Crawford: (TO HOMER AND MARGE) I was so mad at him, I didn't have sex with a clown for five months.
Homer Simpson: What about mimes?
Annie Crawford: (SHRUGS) Come on, I'm not made of stone.
Marge Simpson: Annie, would you ever consider taking Krusty back as a client?
Annie Crawford: (TO KRUSTY, STERNLY) Trust with me is like a candle. When you blow it out, it's gone for good.
Krusty the Clown: What about a comedy candle? You know, that relights itself?
Annie Crawford: I don't find those funny, just frustrating.
Bart Simpson: They're pretty funny. Once I used one on Milhouse. He was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out. (CHUCKLES)
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Good one, boy.
Krusty the Clown: Annie, I'm down on my rebuilt knee. Can't you forgive me? Please? For the sake of me getting what I want?

Krusty the Clown: Let me get this straight: you want me to do my kids' show for adults? They're gonna want F-bombs and all I can give 'em is "ka-ka" and "ta-tas."
Annie Crawford: Krusty, there is nothing people love more than the things they loved when they were kids. So you re-create your show for adults! It worked like magic for Pee-Wee Herman after his setback.
Krusty the Clown: What'd he get in trouble for?
Krusty the Clown: (INCREDULOUS) That's all?! I did that while you were on the phone!
(SPRINGFIELD THEATER: ext. springfield theater - night)
Krusty the Clown: Y'know, I'm a little nervous about doing live theater again.
Annie Crawford: Come on, didn't you do your TV show in front of an audience for years?
Krusty the Clown: Yeah, but they were kids and we gave 'em candy if they laughed. And if they didn't, until the seventies I hit 'em with a stick. Some jerk tracked down the kids and made a documentary. It's called "Circus of Shame" or something.
Sideshow Mel: And now, let's welcome a man the Spanish call "Señor No-Fun": Krusty the Clown!

Annie Crawford: Better, baby.

Krusty the Clown: (SOTTO) Annie, it's your first day on the set. Scream something nice.
Annie Crawford: Krusty, I am here to serve you and no one else. "Nice" gets booked at birthday parties!
Krusty the Clown: Hey, birthday parties got me through some tough times. For years I lived on piñata candy!
Annie Crawford: Yeah? Well from now on the only birthday parties you are gonna do are for the insane sons of rich Middle Eastern dictators. Your going rate is a hundred barrels of oil.

Female Executive: And recently, we had this incident...
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: (TERRIFIED RUNNING NOISES) Wait, wait! What are you doing?
Female Executive: She claimed this intern sharpened her pencil "too pointy."

Krusty the Clown: (ANGUISHED NOISE) That's funnier than I can ever hope to be!
Annie Crawford: Sorry, Janeane. Grab some shrimp and go. You can fill your stupid beret once.
JANEANE GAROFOLO: Burn on you! I brought my expandable beret!
Female Executive: Krusty, this is exactly the kind of meddling that only we're allowed to do. Fire her as we discussed!
Male Executive: (THREATENING) Don't make us threaten you.
Annie Crawford: Krusty?! What did you tell them?
Krusty the Clown: Oh, I, I did that laugh that people interpret any way they want. (DOES THAT LAUGH)

Homer Simpson: See you next Christmas!
Grampa Simpson: (FLASH-FROZEN NOISE)
Skippy: Why did you bring us here, Homer?
Homer Simpson: To prove a point. Everyone thinks their Dad's a jerk and everyone's right. But when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em.
Homer Simpson: Your Dad may be a little immature, but I know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance.
Jiff: You're gonna have to do better than that.
Skippy: (TEARFUL) Oh Dad!

Homer Simpson: You all know I'm a big fan of American meat. Although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle.
Homer Simpson: Take that, centers of art and commerce. And this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. That's right, I'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!
Homer Simpson: When March Madness spills into April -- that's the gravy! When someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy! When you stick your flag in the moon and say "now we're done tryin'" -- that's the gravy!
Homer Simpson: So get on the boat... the gravy boat.
Homer Simpson: (CASUAL) Great show, people. Great show. (TO PROP GUY) Um... Not a big deal, but next time can we use real gravy instead of brown paint? Not a big deal.
Lisa Simpson: So, what's this with the gravy boat?
Homer Simpson: Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U.

Ned Flanders: That's just fine as long as you're not a Mormon!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, you cannot endorse Ted Nugent. I mean, sure, we all love his music...

Ted Nugent: Come on, hurry up and cry so I can get elected and open up the San Diego Zoo for big game huntin'.
Homer Simpson: It's not working... But why?

Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING) We totally wasted his time.
Homer Simpson: (GLEEFUL) And ours! (CHORTLES)
(PARKING STRUCTURE: Ext. parking structure/ext. mall - day)
Homer Simpson: This place is so great. When the trolley hits you, it doesn't even hurt.
Homer Simpson: (POP 'N' FRESH DOUGHBOY GIGGLES) You try it, Maggie!
Maggie Simpson: (SWEET HAPPY GIGGLES)
Marge Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Ooo, condos!
Marge Simpson: Lenny, do you live here?
Lenny Leonard: Yeah, I just moved in!
Lenny Leonard: I have a Drippin' Dots for breakfast every morning, at lunch I get a massage in front of strangers, and then I spend the afternoon browsing cell-phone skins.
Bart Simpson: Ever get tired of those dancing waters?
Lenny Leonard: (UPBEAT) The day I moved in! (A LITTLE DESPERATE) So what are we all gonna do together?
Marge Simpson: Actually, we just came to do some shopping... as a family.
Lenny Leonard: (SAD) Oh. No worries. (POINTS TO SELF) Mr. Mall can make his own excitement.
Lenny Leonard: Give me one doll from every time period, and set me up for a tea party in a private room!
Salesperson: Lenny, you asked me to stop you from coming back in here. Let me help you.
Lenny Leonard: You can help me by giving me Ellis Island Emily! (TAKES DOLL) Hi, dear. I'm your Uncle Lenny. I'm gonna buy you an all new wardrobe, fix your teeth, send you to the best schools, and you're gonna hate and resent me for it... 'cause you're an American now.
Marge Simpson: I was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. Better sort those out.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Do-over!
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS NOISES, THEN:) Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson: (GRIM) Unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Draw the curtain.
Homer Simpson: (BUN GUZZLING NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Sir, as a complexion scientist, I must advise you against using any more. This is the most powerful hydrator we sell.
Homer Simpson: Less blathering, more slathering.
Otto Mann: Yo, Bart dude. Can I get a ride to the food court?
Bart Simpson: Hop on!
(Springfield Mall: int. Mall - blocko store - later)
Lisa Simpson: Hm, I kinda want to create my own thing. Do you sell any just plain sets?
Saleslady: No, we do all the imagining for you.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Well, I'll just buy one of these and build something different.
Saleslady: You do and you'd better build yourself a lawyer.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Miss Simpson, does the court really need to hear...
(Courtroom: int. courtroom - day)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: ...everything that happened in every store your family visited?
Lisa Simpson: Trust me, I've left a lot out, and cleaned up the swears. Anyway, I ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly. (SLIGHTLY SAD) That's what kids do, right? Hang out at the mall together. But when I went over...
(Springfield Mall: ext. mall - day)
Lisa Simpson: Hi, guys, what are you doing?
Sherri Mackleberry: (SNOTTY) Duh, having feathers woven into our hair.
Lisa Simpson: Can I join you?
Terri Mackleberry: Lisa, how can we put this...
Sherri Mackleberry: ...you're the reason no one wears silly bandz anymore.
Lisa Simpson: (AGHAST) They-they don't?
Lisa Simpson: What the--
Lisa Simpson: (SAD NOISE)
(CINNABUN STORE: Int. Cinnabun store - DAY)
Marge Simpson: Enough!

Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED NOISE)
Salesman: Yep, the lightest, most desirable computer in the world for the next three weeks: the Mapple Void.
Seymour Skinner: I wish my dates were this interesting.
Homer Simpson: I'll take it! (DRIVING A HARD BARGAIN) Provided you charge me for services that Google offers for free.
Salesman: (UPBEAT) I already have.
Homer Simpson: Sweet!
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - day - establishing)
Homer Simpson: This computer is so great! I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at "twenty times" speed to make it seem like a normal movie.
Marge Simpson: I think it just froze. Oh no. No, that bird just moved.
Marge Simpson: Uh oh, a draggy backpack.
Lisa Simpson: (SLUMPS INTO CHAIR) I have no friends.
Homer Simpson: (SWEET) Aw, sweetie. Hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?
Lisa Simpson: (CHEERED UP A LITTLE) Okay.
Homer Simpson: Let me just download the complete works of Shakespeare. (HUMS)
Homer Simpson: (SNEAKY CHUCKLE) Now who's the greatest writer of all time?
Lisa Simpson: I'd have more friends if I knew what people liked. But I won't know what people like unless I'm their friend. It's a conundrum.
Bart Simpson: Helpful hint: if you want friends, don't use words like "conundrum."
Bart Simpson: (SCARED) Jimbo heard me say it. I'm dead.
Lisa Simpson: Hm...
Lisa Simpson: It's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person. (GETTING IDEA) What if I started an online meeting place where all are equal and I am the undisputed center?
Jimbo Jones: How's this for a conundrum?
Martin Prince: (WALKING UP) It's not really a conundrum. Sit at my feet and I will elaborate.
(Courtroom: Int. courtroom - present day)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: So to summarize, your honor, Lisa Simpson created this "social network" because she had no friends.
Lisa Simpson: (INTERRUPTS) No, that is not true! I--
Blue-Haired Lawyer: May I remind you you're under oath?!
Lisa Simpson: All right already! (SADLY) I had no friends.
Cletus Spuckler: With an attitude like that, I wouldn't be her friend.
Brandine Del Roy: Life is too dang short.
Lisa Simpson: So, since I had no friends, I assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network. Did we become friends? No.
(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elementary - computer lab - day)
Report Card: (INTENSE COMPUTER PROGRAMMING NOISES)

Report Card: (HAPPY AGREEING NOISES)
Nelson Muntz: Here's my favorite computer game: Angry Nerds!
Martin Prince: (BIRD-LIKE SQUAWKS)
Report Card: (UPSET PIG-LIKE SNORTS)
Martin Prince: Nelson, is there any way I could be your friend?
Nelson Muntz: (DEFIANT) The only way I would be your friend is if I could click a box under your picture saying "Accept friendship request from."
Lisa Simpson: Nelson, you've just given us the template for our site!
Nelson Muntz: I don't care.
Martin Prince: If we don't move, his odds of getting us both are three hundred and seventy-four to one.
Nelson Muntz: Bye.
(Courtroom: int. courtroom - day)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Now, to skip ahead, your diabolical plan was an instant success.
Lisa Simpson: I never said it was diabolical!
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Withdrawn.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: This social network quickly unified the disparate children of Springfield Unified.
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. Springfield elementary - various locations - the past)

Milhouse Van Houten: Santa's Little Helper's friends with Snowball Two? Now I've seen everything!
Ralph Wiggum: All my friends have birthdays this year!
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLES) I just un-friended Skinner!
Seymour Skinner: Doggone it. I'm less popular than the hornet's nest in the gym.
Gary Chalmers: You said you were getting rid of that nest.
Seymour Skinner: We trade the honey for chalk and yardsticks.
Gary Chalmers: Hornets make honey?
Seymour Skinner: (NODS) Better than wasp honey, not as good as bee.
Gary Chalmers: Is this how you talk on dates?
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - afternoon - establishing)
Lisa Simpson: Hit refresh.
Lisa Simpson: Hit refresh.
Lisa Simpson: (AWED) I have a thousand friends! And only eight of them are Milhouse.
Bart Simpson: A thousand kids?! If you could get each of them to send you a dollar you'd be a millionaire!
Marge Simpson: Well, it's not just kids using SpringFace -- it's moms like me. (PROUDLY) Marge!
Lisa Simpson: Wait a minute, grownups are on this?
Marge Simpson: (NODS) Yeah, look!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. Simpson kitchen - continuous)
Patty Bouvier: We've gotta thank you, kiddo.
Selma Bouvier: We've gotten so much more action since we signed up and used this picture of ourselves.
Lisa Simpson: That's not you.
Selma Bouvier: You can see our reflection in the sunglasses.
Patty Bouvier: (SNEAKY CHUCKLE)
Lisa Simpson: (ECSTATIC) Wow, I've created something incredibly popular!
Homer Simpson: And I've created something that created something incredibly popular!
Grampa Simpson: And I created an alcoholic hippo!
Homer Simpson: You never showed it to me.
Grampa Simpson: A stupid alcoholic hippo!
Homer Simpson: I still wanna see it.
Grampa Simpson: (FRUSTRATED) There is no hippo!
Homer Simpson: Then why did you say it?
Grampa Simpson: 'Cause you're the hippo!
Homer Simpson: Are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?
Grampa Simpson: I don't have a hippo!
(Courtroom: int. courtroom - day)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: And so this so-called "SpringFace" spread from the world of children to adults...
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's - evening - THE PAST)
Homer Simpson: (TIPSY) Man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer.
Homer Simpson: I am sitting here... zero sheets to the wind... (SNEAKY CHUCKLE)
Homer Simpson: (HOMER VOICE, BUT DIGNIFIED) ...counting the moments to closing time when I can stumble home to you. Another round, Moe. Uh-oh. Did I type that? (PANICKY) Delete! Delete! (THOUGHTFUL) Hm, typing "delete" does not delete.
Marge Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE)
(First Church of Springfield: int. first church of springfield - continuous)
Patty Bouvier: Hope you like the taste of silver!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: It is gratifying to see all of you bowing in prayer...the light of God shining on your faces...
Lenny Leonard: (NOT LOOKING UP) Uh-oh. Bernice Hibbert keeps "liking" Bumblebee Man's posts. That's how it starts. ("TSK-TSK" NOISES)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Why did I make this church a Wi-Fi hotspot? (SIGHS) If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Let's see, which Muppet am I? (TYPES, THEN ANNOYED) Beaker?! (SIGHS) I guess that's fair.

Ralph Wiggum: Whee!
Lisa Simpson: (CURT) I'm trying to set a mood here.
Ralph Wiggum: (SOMBER) Whee.
(Courtroom: int. courtroom - day)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: So, to sum up, Lisa's social network turned into the biggest internet failure since... well, there've been so many. "Ask Jeeves," anyone?
Courtroom Audience: (LAUGHS)
(Courthouse: Ext. courthouse - moments later - day)
(Courtroom: Ext. courtroom - day - establishing)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: And so SpringFace became too big to control... just like the sixty-foot baby in my self-published novel, "The Sixty-Foot Baby."
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Order it online now, while you can still cheat the government on sales tax.
Lisa Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT) As I was saying, SpringFace was used in ways I never expected.
(Computer Lab: Int. computer lab - continuous)
Milhouse Van Houten: Thanks for SpringFacing me your head cleaver, Bart.
Bart Simpson: (SOTTO) Check this out. I'm hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses, so when Kearney loots their ammo, he gets a face full of ass shrapnel.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Damn, I got ass-shrapped!
(Simpson Car: Ext. Simpson car - driving home from court - day)
