Milhouse Van Houten: Not anymore. (ICE COLD) Friendship over.
Milhouse Van Houten: Taxi!
Bart Simpson: What gives? He's not crawlin' back.

Lisa Simpson: (BURSTS IN) Mom, I'm sorry I'm late! No excuse, I just forgot all about you. (BEAT) Huh? I'm not sure that patch really represents who I am right now.
Marge Simpson: (MIFFED) Well. I usually take Lisa, but I can just go with Bart.
Marge Simpson: Well, if you'd been here for the design phase, you could've registered that objection. Now start quilting! (FRANTIC QUILTING NOISES)
Marge Simpson: Now there's three of you?
3rd Twin: Or maybe you're losing your mind.
(Springfield Elementary School: ExT. SPRINGfield ELEMENTARY - playground - the next day)
Bart Simpson: According to the wisdom of our elders...if you go all the way around on the swing, your body will turn inside-out.
Milhouse Van Houten: Cool, now my beauty will be on the outside.
Bart Simpson: He's still inside-in, folks! And just to prove it:
Kids: ("OOHS" / "AHHS")
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - lisa's bedroom - evening)
Marge Simpson: (READING) "She had now come to the part that Peter Pan hated. 'I do like a mother's love,' said Tootles..."
Lisa Simpson: (SUDDENLY BLURTING OUT) Mom, I have a crush!
Marge Simpson: Is it on your father? Little girls always get crushes on their fathers.
Lisa Simpson: Somehow I missed that phase.
Homer Simpson: Almost there, boy. Almost there. Almost there.
Homer Simpson: I'm getting' closer. It's just within reach.
Lisa Simpson: The boy I like is Hemingway-esque!
Marge Simpson: Okay. Let's "esque" him to dinner. (GIGGLES)
Lisa Simpson: Wow, Nick here in our house. (LOOKS AROUND WORRIED) I hope it doesn't make him think less of me.
Marge Simpson: This house is not an embarrassment!
Marge Simpson: Usually when I say something like that, something extremely embarrassing happens. (BEAT) I'm gonna say goodnight before it does.
Nick: (FLATTERING) Well. Lisa didn't tell me that she had a sister.
Marge Simpson: (EMBARRASSED LAUGH)
Nick: (FLATTERING) Or a daughter.
Marge Simpson: Oh, my. I don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before.
Homer Simpson: Well, your arms are lanky. It's kind of a long trip down there.
Nick: My mother said I should bring some wine.
Homer Simpson: (INTRIGUED) Hm, the French have gotten into the wine game. Good luck catchin' up with the big boys.
Marge Simpson: I'll get a couple glasses.
Nick: Mrs. Simpson, I'd like your permission to take your daughter to the Doritos Nutrition Fair at the school gym.
Marge Simpson: (FIRMLY) You're going with me! But Lisa, after this, I don't want you to spend any more time with this boy. If you do, it'll mean you're a separate person from me.
(Springfield Retirement Castle: INT. RETIREMENT CASTLE - THE NEXT DAY)
Lisa Simpson: Mom can't appreciate the kind of boy Nick is, because although I love Dad, he's a completely different creature.
Grampa Simpson: Yeah, there's a lot of fish in the sea, but she picked out a drunken walrus. But you and this Nick fella sound to me like the story of Pyramus and Thisbe.
Old Jewish Man: Which inspired Romeo and Juliet, which inspired West Side Story, which inspired me to say "eh."
Grampa Simpson: (IGNORING HIM) Pyramus and Thisbe were lovers from ancient times!
Grampa Simpson: They lived next door but their families despised each other.
Pyramus' Father: (FLANDERS' VOICE) I don't like to babble on, but I sure do like Babylon-- (DYING SCREAM)
Grampa Simpson: The lovers had to whisper their sweet nothings through a crack in the wall.
Thisbe: (EXCITED) Wait a minute!
Lisa Simpson: Nick and I met talking through a crack between two booths!
Grampa Simpson: And the power of that forbidden smooch made them love each other forever.
Lisa Simpson: Man, that company thinks every time it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story, they own it.
Parrot: (HOLDS UP WING) Talk to the wing, Thisbe!
Lisa Simpson: Grampa, would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission?
Grampa Simpson: Let me check my schedule.
Grampa Simpson: That might work... I think I'm free... Tuesday's open...
Grampa Simpson: You got it, kiddo.
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. SprinGFIELD ELEMENTARY - girls bathroom - the next DAY)
Bart Simpson: (GRIMLY) Legend has it a girl named Eleanor Mackie drowned on this very spot. Now they say if you call her name three times while looking in this mirror, you will die. Milhouse?
Milhouse Van Houten: Eleanor Mackie. Eleanor Mackie. (A TERRIFIED BEAT, THEN) Eleanor Mackie!
Kids: (SCREAM)
Lunchlady Dora: Aw, gimme a break.
Lou: Chief, we heard gunfire!
Lunchlady Dora: The one day the lunch-lady decides to wash her hands...
Bart Simpson: Okay. That was the last school myth and it's officially... cracked.
Nelson Muntz: So school is just... everything we see? That's sad, man.
Bart Simpson: You into cigars now?
Nelson Muntz: It's a Twix.
Bart Simpson: I can't be the guy who killed everybody's fun. That's Skinner's job.
Seymour Skinner: (PASSING BY) Don't blame me. You killed the fun, fun-killer. (EXITS)
Groundskeeper Willie: (ANGRY GROWL LIKE DOG)
Bart Simpson: Milhouse, I've just figured out a way to make school cool again.
Milhouse Van Houten: American Girl doll day? You might be surprised at the number of boys who have American Girl dolls. It's not weird 'cause they're historic figures.
Bart Simpson: I have found one last myth to destroy -- the so-called legend of Groundskeeper Were-Willie.
Bart Simpson: (BOLDLY) Prepare to be disappointed!
Groundskeeper Willie: (INSANE WOLF HOWL)
Bart Simpson: Gentlemen, we just created a myth.
Groundskeeper Willie: Now there's a myth about me I'd like you to correct: (DRAMATIC) I'm not from Edinburgh! I'm also not from Glasgow! I'm from Kirkwall in Orkney! Me father was an Uppie! And me mother was a Doonie! It tore the family apart! (SOBS)
(Springfield Street: EXT. springfield street - later that day)
Lisa Simpson: Mulberry Island. We'll kiss there at sunset.

(Springfield Retirement Castle: Int. Retirement home - continuous)
Voice From Tv: (LOW) Hola! Yo soy Maury Povich! Uno de estos siete hombres es el verdadero padre de este "crack baby."
Old Jewish Man: (HORRIFIED) Everyone's speaking Spanish!
Lisa Simpson: If we stop now, we'll never make it there by sunset.
Grampa Simpson: Run, young lovers! I'll take care of the cops!
Lisa Simpson: But Grampa...
Grampa Simpson: Go ahead! I ain't afraid of no prison!
Chief Wiggum: Sir, we're gonna bring you back to your retirement home.
Grampa Simpson: Relax! It's just my back...and my hip...spinal column...
(COVE: EXT. COVE - almost sunset)
Nick: Thanks for the ride, Mr. Spuckler.
Cletus Spuckler: Yeah, I don't normally approve of out-breeding, but you two seem nice.
Lisa Simpson: We could take this boat.
Nick: I don't know... This water's a little choppy.
Lisa Simpson: I thought you rowed up the Zambezi without a guide.
Nick: (REMEMBERING HE LIED) Right. Right.
(Simpson Car: Int. Simpson car - continuous)
Homer Simpson: So, Dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in Lisa's head?
Grampa Simpson: She wants to steal a kiss, like Pyramus and Thisbe.
Homer Simpson: Did you say "ultimate Frisbee?"
Grampa Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Marge Simpson: (VERY UPSET NOISE)
Marge Simpson: (GRUNTS OF GREAT EXERTION)
Homer Simpson: Women and shoes, am I right?
Nick: Your hands are really cold.
Lisa Simpson: You know, you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table.
Nick: I sure was! I'm allergic to chocolate!
Lisa Simpson: Shut up and kiss me.
Hadley: Lisa, it's Hadley Richardson, Hemingway's first wife. Trust me, you're making a big mistake.
Hadley: If you don't believe me, ask Pauline Pfeiffer.
Pauline Pfeiffer: I was his second wife. There were two more after me. Tortured writers make horrible husbands.
Marlin: (NATHAN LANE VOICE) At least you chose to be with him. I was just swimmin' along, mindin' my own business. Next thing I know, I was hanging on his wall! He used to pee in the fireplace! (CRIES)
Lisa Simpson: Wait, how long is this love for again?
Nick: Eternity!
Lisa Simpson: Hm, that's a pretty long time.
Nick: Now my lips are getting cold.
Marge Simpson: (PANTING) Lisa!
Nick: This isn't working out. Lisa, I'm sorry that God gave me this gift of lying to girls, for a little while. I'll see you.
Marge Simpson: I feel kinda silly I walked all the way out here. You're just fine. You always are.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - backyard - a little later)
(STORM SHELTER: Int. storm shelter - continuous)
Lisa Simpson: Thanks. But I couldn't have done it, Mom. I mean, the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you'll love for the rest of your life.

Homer Simpson: (UNDERWATER ANNOYED GRUNT)
Kent Brockman: Good evening. It is with great sadness I inform you that America and China have declared war, and a massive nuclear attack is expected to reach our shores within the hour.
Homer Simpson: (SHORT SHRIEK)
Kent Brockman: (CHUCKLES) That's the sort of hypothetical emergency today's disaster preparedness drill is designed to get us ready for.
Homer Simpson: (RELIEVED NOISE)
Kent Brockman: All Springfielders should now move off the streets and inside their homes. Please avoid the superstitious panic which marked the recent lunar eclipse.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES, THEN TO GRAMPA) Sorry, Dad. I was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up.
Grampa Simpson: You idjit! The dragon always coughs the moon back up!
Lisa Simpson: I know it's futile, but I must again point out there is no dragon.
Homer Simpson: Then why am I paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?
Lisa Simpson: Again, I maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, everyone knows dragons do not attack cars. Jeez, pick up a book.
Lisa Simpson: (FRUSTRATED) I pick up books like you pick up beers!
Homer Simpson: (GRIM) Then you have a serious reading problem.
Kent Brockman: Now remember, this is only a drill.
Kent Brockman: (TOTAL PANIC) Aaagh! The missiles really are coming! The so-called "drill" is just a way to get you into shelters without causing total chaos!
Kent Brockman: (CALM) Is what I would say, if this weren't a drill.
Kent Brockman: (FAINT) This is not a drill!
Marge Simpson: Now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
Homer Simpson: So do your farting now.
Marge Simpson: Homie! What if that was the last thing you ever said?
Homer Simpson: Don't worry. My last words will be "I can outrun that lion."
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS)
Homer Simpson: All right, everybody in!
Marge Simpson: All right, who's the wisenheimer that's been eating the powdered food?
Bart Simpson: Not me. (COUGHS)
Homer Simpson: Two can play at that game.
Homer Simpson: (CHOKING NOISE) I can do this... I can do this... (RETCHING NOISE)
Homer Simpson: Boy, I told you an hour ago. Stop that!
Bart Simpson: But Bunkerball is keeping us sane!
Lisa Simpson: Do we really have to sit here the whole time? I mean, if we went out now, it might be cool to see the town empty.
Bart Simpson: (STOPS BOUNCING BALL) Yeah! I could sneak into the school and write whatever I want on the chalkboard!
Lisa Simpson: I could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
Homer Simpson: And I can drive drunk while I'm actually sober!
(Springfield Streets: ext. springfield streets - day)
Homer Simpson: It's fun, but not as fun.
Marge Simpson: That's odd.
Marge Simpson: Why are all those cars parked at City Hall? (POINTS)
Bart Simpson: Ay carumba!
Lisa Simpson: (PUZZLED) If I didn't know better, I'd say it was a town meeting.
Marge Simpson: Not without us, it isn't! Pull over.
(Springfield Town Hall: Int. Town hall - FOYER - moments LATER)
(TOWN HALL MEETING ROOM: int. town hall meeting room - continuous)
Mayor Joe Quimby: Welcome to this secret meeting, made possible by the fake disaster drill. And a special thanks for the hard work of the Mystery And Secrecy Committee.
Cloaked Member: (CHALMERS' VOICE) We have names, you know!
Mayor Joe Quimby: Quit complaining! You only meet once a month!
Comic Book Guy: Yes, but the meetings last eight hours!
Disco Stu: (VERY UPSET) Shut up! Shut up! This is the most fun I have!
Mayor Joe Quimby: And now for the reason we are here.
Marge Simpson: (SOTTO) What's going on? Why is there a picture of us? This isn't good.
Homer Simpson: Oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?
Mayor Joe Quimby: The results are in: this town has voted unanimously to get rid of Springfield's unending nightmare: the Simpsons.
Lisa Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Moe Szyslak: They're here! The monsters are here!
Marge Simpson: Moe, it's me, Marge! I'm your friend!
Moe Szyslak: The monster queen is comin' on to me!
(Springfield Town Hall: EXT. TOWN HALL - mOMENTS LATER - establishing)
Lisa Simpson: Why would you want to banish us from Springfield?
Homer Simpson: Yeah. We're like family to you. I'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy.
Otto Mann: I'll have you know I'm also a hair donor! Salma Hayek wore me to the Oscars!
Mayor Joe Quimby: This is not about who wore whose hair where. We are here to banish the Simpsons, although we are not pleased to be doing so.
Chief Wiggum: I am!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Me too. (CHUCKLE)
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: I feel like a kid at Christmas!
Sideshow Bob: I believe you know my position.
Mayor Joe Quimby: (SOTTO) I know we're all happy-- I'm just trying to spare their feelings.
Cookie Kwan: Those freaks have no feelings! Even baby never cry!
Cookie Kwan: What baby does that?!
Marge Simpson: Why would an entire town go to all this fuss to get rid of one family? What have we done that's so terrible?
Mayor Joe Quimby: I'm glad you asked.
Mayor Joe Quimby: The simple fact is, the city is going broke cleaning up after Homer's drunken shenanigans...
Homer Simpson: We won! Woo hoo!
Marge Simpson: (ANGRY SOTTO) Homer! That is not banishment-hearing behavior!
Mayor Joe Quimby: Bart's pranks, which dwindle in humor as they rise in destruction...
Mayor Joe Quimby: And Liser's environmental initiatives...
Marge Simpson: If I may speak.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Um-hm.
Marge Simpson: We're not monsters. We're just people. People who love each other and love this town. The only place we've ever called home. (CHOKED-UP SOB) Thank you.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Marge, you are a sweet woman and you make us see your family in a more forgiving light.
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED) Thank you.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Which is why you're the worst Simpson of all!
Marge Simpson: (INCREDIBLY-SHOCKED NOISE)
Townspeople: (RISING ANGER)
Homer Simpson: Now, now, now just a second here! Now, I know we're not perfect. But, uh, I believe it was Sammy Hagar who said--
Sideshow Mel: Silence!
Sideshow Mel: That was an "inside me" bone!
Townspeople: (ANGRY GRUMBLING)
Ned Flanders: Make way for Captain Coolerhead!
Ned Flanders: Now, I like a good old-fashioned witch trial as much as the next person, but I do not think we should be so quick to judge our long-time neighbors...
Mayor Joe Quimby: Not so fast, Flanders. We knew you'd be the voice of mercy. And we're prepared to answer your concerns.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Any other objections?
(Parking Lot: Ext. parking lot - continuous)
Ned Flanders: I withdraw my... diddily... (PASSES OUT)
(Outskirts Of Town: ext. outskirts of town - day)
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) I always thought "tarred and feathered" was just a figure of speech.
Homer Simpson: (BITTER) Good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now!
Mayor Joe Quimby: (CLEARS THROAT) Simpsons, in accordance with article six, section two of the town charter...
Homer Simpson: (ONE LAST CHANCE) Wait! (OMINOUS) If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought.
Homer Simpson: I mean a thousand-year flood!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) I mean a thousand years of perfect weather.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Just get out!

Marge Simpson: (SADLY) That was the last Springfield radio station. Now we just get Shelbyville talk radio. (TURNS DIAL)
Shelbyville Announcer: If you see a Simpson, do not try to reason with it. Just kill it and turn in the pelt for a free soda.
Homer Simpson: Soda, eh?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, where are we going? Do we have a plan?
Homer Simpson: (SOBS) Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. (INCREASINGLY MACHO) Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- (FALSETTO) Girling down! Girling down!
(ART GALLERY - CONTINUOUS: Int. art gallery - continuous)
Bart Simpson: Hey, Henrietta Hippo, I've got to drain the inchworm.

Bart Simpson: I just got started!
Homer Simpson: Not you! Him!
Mountain Man: You best get back where you belong!
Marge Simpson: Please sir, we've been thrown out of a place we've always called home. We just wanna live out our lives in peace.
Mountain Man: (FRIENDLY) Rejected by society, huh? Well, why didn't you say so? Welcome to the off-the-grid, unincorporated settlement we proudly call "The Outlands!"
Homer Simpson: We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window.
Mountain Man: (OMINOUS) Oh, I wouldn't be openin' no windows. Coyotes will take your baby.
Mountain Man: (SINGING) THE OUT-LANDS!
Homer Simpson: Eh, I'm sick of watching Fox. Let's get some fresh air. (ENTICING) I got the ATV's right out back.
Bart Simpson: Should I get my helmet?
Homer Simpson: Helmet? That's Springfield talk.
(THE OUTLANDS: ext. the outlands - simpsons' squat - moments later)
Bart Simpson: Is there gas in these?
Homer Simpson: Springfield talk!
Bart Simpson: Well how are we supposed to get fuel?
Homer Simpson: (DUH) Private plane crashes.
Lisa Simpson: (BREATHES DEEPLY) Ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! Y'know, I'm glad we're in exile.
Homer Simpson: Yep, I never realized how much I hated every single one of my friends and relatives.
Marge Simpson: I don't think this place is so great.
Marge Simpson: I'm trying to make the best of things, but I'm worried Maggie is falling in with a bad crowd.
Babies: (CHANTING BABY NOISES)
Marge Simpson: (EMOTIONAL) I miss our home and I want to go back.
Lisa Simpson: It's not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, Wikileaks is right over there.
Bart Simpson: How're you doin', Mr. Assange?
Julian Assange: That's my personal information and you have no right to know about it. (FRIENDLY) Hey, but we're neighbors... would you like to come over for a movie sometime?
Marge Simpson: Is it Iraqi journalists being murdered?
C. Montgomery Burns: Getting a little clingy, aren't we?
Julian Assange: Don't be ridiculous. It's an Afghan wedding being bombed.
Homer Simpson: Well I've got a really big secret for you... (LOUD WHISPER) I'm not wearing any underwear.
Julian Assange: You know, you should really get out less.
Marge Simpson: He's no Ned Flanders. And I miss the Springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. God help me, I even miss Helen Lovejoy criticizing my brownies. (SMALL SOBS)
Homer Simpson: Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes.
Bart Simpson: Yes it does.
Homer Simpson: Pipe down, boy. (TURNS TO MARGE) I'm sneaking you back into Springfield.
(Springfield: Ext. Springfield - city limits - evening)
Homer Simpson: ("BURNS") Oh, "Smithers"!
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) Homie, these disguises won't fool anyone.
Homer Simpson: (IMITATING BURNS) Pish tosh, Smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! (HOMER VOICE, CHUCKLES) Nailed it!
Chief Wiggum: Hold it right there!
Chief Wiggum: Mr. Burns! You might catch a cold out this late. You want my jacket? Here, lemme warm my gun up for ya.
Homer Simpson: ("BURNS") Excellent.
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, it wouldn't be you if you didn't say "excellent."
(Lard Lad Donuts: Ext. lard lad donuts - night)
Homer Simpson: (SLIGHTLY TIPSY) You know what's great about you, Marge? After all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you.
Marge Simpson: Look! A shooting star!
Homer Simpson: Do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?
Marge Simpson: (SMILES) On a night like tonight I have to believe there are.

Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) There's no sex like fugitive sex.

Homer Simpson: (SCARED) Someone's downstairs!
Jimbo Jones: (COCKS HEAD) I think I heard a pair of underpants being picked up off the ground. Big ones!
DOLPH: It's them! Bart's mom and the fat guy!
DOLPH: Let's turn 'em in.
Chief Wiggum: Not so fast. This case was already cracked...by the last person you'd expect -- the Chief of Police! You really thought you could fool me with that Burns and Smithers getup? I mean, I'm not the sharpest pencil in the pencil thing, but I'm at least as smart as a cat. Right, Lou?
Lou: What breed, Chief?
Lou: I mean, I saw an Abyssinian once who could change channels.
Chief Wiggum: (ADMITTING) That is pretty smart.
Homer Simpson: All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? (MOCKING) Throw us out of town again?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Crucify them! And screw the boulder in tight!
Krusty the Clown: Make 'em write monologue jokes!
Sideshow Mel: Cancel their subscription to the opera!
Homer Simpson: We hate opera!
Sideshow Mel: Then get them a subscription to the opera!
Homer Simpson: Nooo!
Gil Gunderson: (WILD-EYED) I say shoot 'em!
Chief Wiggum: Now hold on just a minute. Nobody said anything about shooting.
Gil Gunderson: (CALMLY) I did. Just now.
Chief Wiggum: Ah, that's right, you did. Well, all right.
Marge Simpson: Don't even bother shooting us. We've found a new place that we love. A place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more...
Homer Simpson: Yeah. Non-jerks!
Homer Simpson: (GASPS)
Mayor Joe Quimby: Maybe he's right. We are jerks.
Mayor Joe Quimby: You want I should spray some of my "Jerk Off" on ya?
Mayor Joe Quimby: (DISMISSIVE) Eh -- it's okay.
Mayor Joe Quimby: In our new community, people accept others for who they are. I thought I wanted to come back to my house, but instead, I'm going to go back to my home.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, bah to them. (LOOKING DOWN) Let's go, Smithers.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, all right.
Waylon Smithers: That's all it took? I just had to ask?
(OUTLANDS: Ext. outlands - day)
Homer Simpson: (HAPPY HUMMING, THEN:) Well, I've tightened the bolt! I think we're good!
Bart Simpson: You sure this is a good idea?

Homer Simpson: Hey Lenny, welcome aboard.
Homer Simpson: Now, I gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint.
Lenny Leonard: I don't mind. I want a fresh start... and so does Carl.
Carl Carlson: Get her off! Get her off!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep.
Carl Carlson: No!
Homer Simpson: (GRIM) That's not a choice you get to make.
Carl Carlson: This is pretty tasty.
Lenny Leonard: Yep. And I like how it's dissolving a hole in the cup.
Moe Szyslak: (TRYING TO WIN THEM BACK) Hey! Guys! What can I getcha?
Homer Simpson: Forget it. We don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.
Moe Szyslak: Sure, sure. I understand. But if you change your minds, I'll be here in this cave.
Lenny Leonard: I got a funny feeling our paradise is about to get ruined by unwanted guests.
Carl Carlson: I probably shouldn't have given this place five stars on Yelp.
Homer Simpson: (SHRUGS) Well, I rented that plane.
Mountain Man: Oh, that tears it! I am not comfortable being this close to medical care. I'm outta here.
Marge Simpson: What are you doing here?
Mayor Joe Quimby: I, uh, heard everything was goin' great in your new Eden, with one flaw: you lack a corrupt city government.
Homer Simpson: True, true.
Gary Chalmers: And a school system that teaches to the test, sneaks the kids the answers and still fails.
Marge Simpson: Stop! Stop! This is everything we put behind us!
Sideshow Mel: You can't leave civilization, Marge. Humanity is an inexorable upward march. Or was till the year two thousand.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I did miss a few things about the grid... like everything!
Lisa Simpson: Maureen Dowd, we've got a lot of catching up to do.

Homer Simpson: You know sweetie, there was a time when I would've killed for that information, but I'm pleased to announce I've already bought your mother a present.
Lisa Simpson: (INCREDIBLY-SHOCKED GASP)

Lisa Simpson: These'll go great with ("BEETEL") betel nut butter!
Homer Simpson: Wow. I don't believe the Simpsons will be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart anymore.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh really?
Homer Simpson: Apu! What are you doing out of your natural habitat?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: I am finding out who my real customers are, and who is going to cheat on my store with some South-Sea sugar shack!
Lisa Simpson: But at the Kwik-E-Mart, the only fresh fruit is the one banana by the register.
Sideshow Mel: You keep your ice cream right beside the motor oil!
Nelson Muntz: You sell cigarettes to kids!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Now see here. I have always considered you cash-giving cows to be my friends. And friends do not betray friends!
Homer Simpson: (DEFIANT) Friends are the only people you can betray! And you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (DISGUSTED SOUND) Defend yourself, sir!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Convenience forever, freshness never!
Homer Simpson: Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
Paula Paul: (SIGNING BOX) Uh-huh... (LOOKS UP) You know, while I was signing this for your wife, I just cooked up...
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED NOISE)
Paula Paul: ...a great idea!
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Paula Paul: How would you like it if I called your wife live from my show tomorrow to wish her a happy birthday?
Homer Simpson: You would do that? (EXCITED GASP, TO SELF) Oh my God, this might be a Marge's birthday where I get sex!
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - the next day - ESTABLISHING)
Marge Simpson: Ooh! An apron with a sonnet!
Bart Simpson: Open mine! Quick, before it suffocates!
Marge Simpson: A bunny! Just like the one I had when I was a girl! How did you know?
Bart Simpson: Check it out! It's on TV!
Ron English: (POINTS TO SIGN) No refunds.
Bart Simpson: I saw this picture at Grandma's house, then I hit the pet stores till I found one that looked just like it.
Marge Simpson: Oh Bart, you got me the fluffy pet I've never stopped thinking about!
Marge Simpson: Now, last but not least, your present, Homie.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS EXCITEMENT) Wait one sec, Marge. Before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever.
Marge Simpson: Well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good.
Homer Simpson: The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. (CHECKS WATCH) Now in three... two... one...
Homer Simpson: I repeat. One...
Homer Simpson: (DRAWING IT OUT AS LONG AS HE CAN) Onnnnnnneee... (ENDS WITH BIG COUGH)
Homer Simpson: (RASPY) ...Onnneee... onnneee...
Marge Simpson: (WEARY) Please don't say one again.
Homer Simpson: (ALMOST A WHISPER) Onnneee.
Marge Simpson: Homie, whatever it is, it's not happening.
Homer Simpson: This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!
Marge Simpson: (SHRUGS SADLY) Well, at least you remembered I like her.
Homer Simpson: A pity kiss?! (IRATE) That tears it! (POINTS TO BOX) I'm gonna call that Paula Paul and give her a piece of my mind!
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE) The phone's dead.
Homer Simpson: Normal, normal, normal, normal... (GREAT SHOCK) uncharacteristic?! (EXAMINES TORN CORD) Hm, a chew-through. What could have...
Homer Simpson: (SWEET) Aw... I mean (FURIOUS) arrrgh!
Bart Simpson: Aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity.
Homer Simpson: You let this monster into our home! Where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
Lisa Simpson: Wait! Maybe Paula Paul left a message.
Paula Paul: Hi, Marge! Paula Paul here, calling live from "What's On Paula's Windowsill?", ready to wish you a happy birthday... (DISAPPOINTED) ...but since you're not home yet, we'll go to commercial and call you right back. (BEEP) Hi, Paula Paul, calling back for Marge Simpson! (SLIGHTLY TESTY) Kind of a big moment for you, a little surprised you're not picking up! (BEEP) Marge, this is just plain disrespectful. I bumped a segment to do this and you're making me look like an ass! (BEEP, SOBBING) Screw you, Marge Simpson! Don't read my books and don't make my recipes! May my curse follow you beyond the grave!
Paula Paul: (TOTAL VITRIOL) They're booing you, Marge! An audience full of church groups and marines!
Marine: Marge, go to Hell, Marge!
Marge Simpson: I think that's enough birthday fun.
Homer Simpson: (TOTALLY ENRAGED) Why you little... I'm gonna get... (THINKS) No, Homer. You can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. Juries hate that. So instead, boy, I want you to... (ANGRY THINKING NOISES, THEN:) get in that rabbit cage!
Bart Simpson: No way, man! I'm a free-range kid!
Homer Simpson: No backtalk! In the cage! Now!
Homer Simpson: (GRIMLY) Get in there!
Homer Simpson: Son, do you have a minute?
Homer Simpson: I've been thinking. I really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. So I'm gonna let you out with my apologies.
Bart Simpson: Don't wanna come out.
Homer Simpson: (AGGRAVATED NOISE) What?
Bart Simpson: I like it in the cage. These cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
Homer Simpson: (MAD) Boy, get out of that cage!
Bart Simpson: But it's my home now, sir.
Homer Simpson: (FRUSTRATED NOISE) I'll poke a broom in there! You know I'm capable of it!

Homer Simpson: Heard about this thing, boy?
Bart Simpson: No, no, I'm too concerned with unemployment.
Homer Simpson: Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?
Marge Simpson: (ENTERING, ALARMED) Homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?
Homer Simpson: Not now, Marge!
Kent Brockman: Chief, any leads on this "Vandal Van Gogh?"
Chief Wiggum: I don't traffic in wordplay, Kent. But I do have a message for Mr. "Prank Lloyd Wright."
Lou: Uh, that's architecture, not painting, Chief.
Chief Wiggum: They're all artists, Lou! Why don't you open your eyes. (TURNS TO CAMERA) Now, as for Mr. Prank Gehry, you may have thumbed your nose at the police...and made yourself into a combination of Robin Hood, Luke Skywalker and, well, every rapper ever...but unless you prove that this wasn't just a one-time spree, and take your controversial art form to the next level, I am not impressed.

Snake Jailbird: Alright, chill, bro. Just chill.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: I will chill you, right between your damn eyes! For once, the Indian has been outsourced!
Snake Jailbird: Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. Just give me the piece. You've got a family, dude, or were you lying when you begged for your life?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (CRESTFALLEN) Sweet Vishnu the Destroyer, what have I done?
Snake Jailbird: It's okay. The jails, they don't have room for us now. Wiggum just makes you do book reports for Ralph. But you have to make 'em so it looks like he's done it. That's kinda the hard part.

Bart Simpson: Hey, I got an F in art. Mainly so it would say "fart" on my report card.
Shepard Fairey: (LOOKS AROUND) Bart, we would love to set up a gallery show for your street art.
Bart Simpson: Well, if it's in a Gallery, how is it street art?
Shepard Fairey: Bart, street art is not about questioning authority.
Bart Simpson: (THINKS) Well, I'll have to discuss it with my partner.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, say yes! At the opening, I could wear a sports jacket with a t-shirt and jeans!
Bart Simpson: First, I'm not sure you have the shoulders for it, and second, maybe we've pushed this far enough.

Bart Simpson: Correction. It's worth ten times as much.
Homer Simpson: (ECSTATIC) Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy.
Bart Simpson: You're welcome. And from now on, Dad, if anyone laughs at you, they've gotta go through me.
Homer Simpson: Really, anyone? (POSING A QUESTION) What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?
Bart Simpson: Wait, is the Hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?
Homer Simpson: Both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. He's just trying to fit in.

Chief Wiggum: Hold it right there, Spray-candy Warhol!
Chief Wiggum: Bart Simpson, you're under arrest for tagging the town. This overdue art-quake that taught us all a new way of seeing was actually a police department sting!
Bart Simpson: (STUNNED) It was?
Chief Wiggum: Yeah. Do you think people would be stupid enough to pay for something some amateur put on a wall for nothing?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, no indeed! Now if I can just get my three million dollars back...

Shepard Fairey: Hey, don't be so surprised. I spent twenty years putting up posters that said "obey."
Grampa Simpson: (TO SHEPARD FAIREY) What gives, Daddy-O? I thought you were the dean of the underground scene.
Shepard Fairey: I'm not in the business of helping out posers any more. Now I just sell stuff to them.
Marge Simpson: Wait, wait, wait. He's just a boy! Do you have to put him in jail?
Chief Wiggum: Well, we've gotta teach him a lesson somehow.

Homer Simpson: Sorry. Before we die, can you tell me how old you really are?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, it has four digits...
Lenny Leonard: Unemployed Springfielders to the rescue!
Carl Carlson: (IN WIENER DOG OUTFIT) And underemployed!
Waylon Smithers: To servos with love!
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) Guys, thank you. The words "prime directive" get thrown around a lot these days, but I'm glad yours was saving me. The saddest part is none of this had to happen, if Mr. Burns had simply trusted the human worker. Or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings.
Robot #1: I told you precisely that fact one thousand five hundred sixty-two t--
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) And his arm can be my back-scratcher.
Homer Simpson: (ANGUISHED NOISE)
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, I've learned the robotic worker is no match for the old-fashioned man of labor. You're all hired back... as temps!
(Lake Springfield: Ext. lake springfield - day)
Fishing Robot: Homer, why have you reprogrammed me for this?
Homer Simpson: I'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
Fishing Robot: I am real and I do not have wishes.
Homer Simpson: Then take us out to sea.
Fishing Robot: I am not a transformer. I cannot turn into an outboard motor.
Homer Simpson: Oh, I believe you, but Flanders' drill doesn't.
Fishing Robot: (IMITATING MOTOR NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Oh, this is the life.
Homer Simpson: Hey!

Bart Simpson: (AGGRAVATED) That movie's for babies.
Homer Simpson: (SHRUGS) Watch whatever you want -- I got you here alive. (CHUCKLES) Now I'm gonna visit the only court I could never be in contempt of: food court. (CHUCKLES)
Homer Simpson: Now, to save on calories, I won't eat the paper in the fortune cookie.
Homer Simpson: (MILD EXERTION, THEN HEAVY WHEEZING NOISES AS HE WALKS)
Fitness Salesman: Sir, I can't help but noticing that you are very near death.
Homer Simpson: (PROUDLY) Closer than you think!
(SPORT PALAIS: int. sport palais - treadmill section - moments later)
Fitness Salesman: Homer... can I call you Homer?
Homer Simpson: Sure. What's your name?
Fitness Salesman: I'm not required to tell you that. Homer, how long do you want to live?
Homer Simpson: (WISTFUL) Long enough that me and Marge can be one of those couples who just sit and hold hands.
Elderly Homer: I heard Lenny had a terrible fall.
Elderly Marge: You know who else fell? Dr. Hibbert!
Elderly Homer: (RUEFUL) Yeah, falls'll getcha.
Fitness Salesman: Well, I want to help you make it to that glorious day. For money.

Homer Simpson: (MOANS) But I can't afford this...

Homer Simpson: (SADLY) No.
Fitness Salesman: Well, what about ten dollars a day?
Homer Simpson: (EXUBERANT) Easy!

Bart Simpson: (TEETH CLENCHED, TO MILHOUSE) Get that stuff off!
Milhouse Van Houten: Take a picture first.
Bart Simpson: Now!
DOLPH: (BRAGGING) We're gonna be checking out a delightful Hong Kong horror remake known as "Crawlspace," based on (SAYS CHINESE TITLE) Paxing kongjian ("PAH SHING KONG JEE-EN")
Shauna Chalmers: Well count me out, Jimbo. I don't need to hear how every chick in the movie got what was coming to them.
Jimbo Jones: Shauna, food for thought: if we don't watch movies about torture in crawl spaces, how will we know what to do if someone puts us in a torture crawl space?
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Not if, when.
Shauna Chalmers: Nah, I'm gonna go see one of those Jennifer Aniston movies where she rolls her eyes on the poster.
Jimbo Jones: Babe, you know I don't want you watching a movie by yourself. You're a total perv magnet.
Shauna Chalmers: (FLATTERED) Aww.
Jimbo Jones: So, I'll find someone to take you. Someone unthreatening.
Shauna Chalmers: Hey! You know our deal: chaperones cannot be humiliating.
Milhouse Van Houten: She's got ya there.
Shauna Chalmers: How 'bout this one?
Jimbo Jones: Simpson? Let's see... (EXAMINES UPPER LIP) no starter-stache, temp tat--
Jimbo Jones: (LOOKS IN MOUTH) ...still has baby teeth at nine and twenty-four... Total prepuber.
Jimbo Jones: Now you stay close to my Shauna, if someone so much as peels a ladybug decal off her fake fingernails, I'm blaming you.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: C'mon, c'mon! The best murder is always first!
Terrified Man: Not my eyelids!
("ALL THE WRONG REASONS" MOVIE THEATER: int. "ALL THE WRONG REASONS" movie theater - later SCENE 3)
Jennifer Aniston: (FURIOUS) Are you telling me the real reason you started dating me was so you could buy my flower shop?
Handsome Funny Guy: (SUAVE, BUT NOT BRITISH) Yes. Your lease was the last thing stopping me from tearing this place down and building the biggest horse crematorium in Manhattan. But none of that matters now.
Shauna Chalmers: All right, we've seen his ass. Let's go.
(Springfield Mall: int. mall - food court - a little later)
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: (FLIRTY) Hey, I can hook you up with pinto and black beans.
Shauna Chalmers: I'll do anything for free beans. Anything.
Bart Simpson: Hey, nametag! Do you know who her boyfriend is? Jimbo Jones!
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: (TERRIFIED) I gotta go sort tortillas. (SCARED NOISE)
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: (QUICKLY) Corn, flour, corn, corn, no gluten, corn, two stuck together?! (AGGRAVATED NOISE) Now I've gotta fill out a form.
Bart Simpson: Listen lady, you do not two-time the man with the skull t-shirt.
Shauna Chalmers: (SNORTS) Jimbo doesn't care about me -- he didn't even notice my side braid!
Bart Simpson: Oh, that is cool. Looks like two snakes trying to kill each other on your head.
Shauna Chalmers: That's what I was going for! You know, for a second grader, you're pretty sharp.
Bart Simpson: I'm actually in fourth grade, (COCKY) but I read at a second grade level. (COOL) They think I might have a "problem."
Shauna Chalmers: (INTRIGUED NOISE)
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (VERY SHAKEN) Why did I see that movie the day before I have to clean the crawlspace?
Homer Simpson: (WAVING ACROSS MALL) C'mon, boy. We've gotta go home. I saved big bucks on the delivery charges.
Homer Simpson: (MUFFLED ANNOYED GRUNT)
Bart Simpson: I gotta go -- he's my ride.
Jimbo Jones: Not so fast, Simpson. F.Y.I., you got another "date" tomorrow with Shauna.
Bart Simpson: (ALARMED) Why can't you do it?
Jimbo Jones: We're going to a seminar: "Extracting Lunch Money from a Cashless Society."
DOLPH: We're gonna rob the guy givin' the seminar.
Shauna Chalmers: Bart and I'll figure out something.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) Yeah.
Homer Simpson: (SATISFIED) Ahhh. Doesn't get any better than this.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day - establishing)
Homer Simpson: Huh, that's weird, my armpits are gettin' wet.
Lisa Simpson: Wow, the TV's hooked up to the internet! You can stream whole seasons of old TV shows.
Homer Simpson: Hmm... (SCANS THROUGH MENUS, VERY QUICKLY)
Homer Simpson: Seen it.
Homer Simpson: Seen it.
Homer Simpson: Seen it.
Homer Simpson: British version was better.
Homer Simpson: Totally scripted.
Homer Simpson: Sued it.
Homer Simpson: (CURIOUS) "Stranded?" What's that?
Lisa Simpson: "Stranded" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. It was huge! (BEAT) Well, the first season and the last season.
Homer Simpson: Well, islands are always entertaining, from Gilligan to Iwo Jima.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) A plane crash!
(BASEMENT: int. basement - day)
Homer Simpson: (ALARMED) Wait a minute... that flashback raised more questions than it answered?!

Bart Simpson: Huh?
Guard: Young lady, I need to check your purse.
Shauna Chalmers: I didn't steal nothin'.
Thought Bubble Jimbo: If anything happens to her I'll beat you up from inside your brain.
Bart Simpson: I stole this...
Guard: You stole perfume?
Bart Simpson: Uh, yeah, me. I use it all the time.
Bart Simpson: (TUNING UP, SINGING) MI-MI-MI-MI-MI...
Guard: YOU-YOU-YOU-YOU and I are taking a trip to mall jail.
Bart Simpson: Isn't that what used to be the Beanie Baby store?
Guard: Shut up!
(Springfield Mall: Int. mall - security area - a little later)
Shauna Chalmers: This is so cool. You took a fall for me. No one's done anything for me before. (LOOKING BACK) Uh-oh.
Bart Simpson: Don't worry. I made sure he can't get too far.
Guard: I'd use my legs but I've forgotten how!
Shauna Chalmers: (TO BART, SUGGESTIVELY) Come with me.

Marge Simpson: Bart, you haven't touched your mashed potatoes.
Grampa Simpson: More breast?
Bart Simpson: (STARTLED NOISE) No!
Grampa Simpson: I'm offerin' ya a chicken breast, ya boob!
Bart Simpson: (UNCOMFORTABLE) Doesn't anyone here realize I'm only ten years old?
Marge Simpson: Bart, no dinner means no dessert.
Bart Simpson: (ANGUISHED) I'm just not ready for cookies!
Homer Simpson: You know, I should get back to the treadmill.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: He exercises so much, but he looks the same. I guess the weight will all come off at once some day in the future.
Grampa Simpson: Don't you believe anything Homer says. His first word was a lie!
1-Year-Old Homer: Mommy.
Strange Man: Don't believe anything you were told by me in the past, because that was not me! But this is me now, but in less than a second I will be gone forever.
Strange Man: (DOPPLER) I might be back!
Homer Simpson: (GASP) The lava being! That's why they showed a clip of it on "previously on."
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Marge Simpson: (ANGRY) You're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? And when I wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!
Homer Simpson: (CRAZED) Marge, there're so many mysteries that I need to have solved.
Bart's Thoughts: Oh my God! It's just like Dad's!
Homer Simpson: Now, if the Korean couple can't speak English, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was "enigma" spelled backwards? What does it mean?
Marge Simpson: It means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
Homer Simpson: And where will I watch TV?
Marge Simpson: On the TV!
Homer Simpson: And where will I walk?
Marge Simpson: On the ground!
Homer Simpson: And where...
Marge Simpson: This is the stupidest fight ever!
Homer Simpson: (DEFIANT) We've had stupider!
Marge Simpson: I don't think so.

Shauna Chalmers: (MESSY TEENAGER KISSING NOISES)
Shauna Chalmers: So, what do you want to do now?
Bart Simpson: What any boy would: push you in a puddle and run away.
Shauna Chalmers: Maybe I should be faithful to Jimbo. He's bought me a lot of gum over the past couple months.
Bart Simpson: Listen... I could get wedgied for this, but Jimbo's a jerk. You can do better.
Shauna Chalmers: Wow. You told me what's best for me... at risk to yourself. (ENTICING) Come with me.

Homer Simpson: (SUGGESTIVE) The kids are away and Maggie's napping...
Homer Simpson: Ooh, that's great! Can it wait another hundred and four hours?
Homer Simpson: She walked away and slammed the door. (ANGUISHED) What does it mean? What does it mean?
Marge Simpson: It means I'm mad!
Homer Simpson: Oh that's such a first-take answer!
Chief Wiggum: This one's yours, Ralphie.
Jimbo Jones: Simpson, I guess you don't have much respect for me.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - afternoon)
Bart Simpson: Well, who wears a wool hat to a pool?
Bart Simpson: (BURSTS OUT LAUGHING, THEN SCARED:) It's not fair! You know that's hilarious! (GIGGLES)
Lifeguard: No horseplay in the pool area!
Jimbo Jones: This isn't "play" -- this is some serious payback.
Lifeguard: Well that's, um... (CHECKS RULES POSTED ON WALL) Alright, you may have found a loophole. I, I better check... (PICKS UP PHONE) Hello, Abby? (AGGRAVATED) I'm not calling about the shift change. God! But, well, since you bring it up, if there's a way to flip Saturday with next Wednesday...
Jimbo Jones: (COCKING FIST) Simpson, prepare to--
Jimbo Jones: We see Bart running frantically toward the exit.
Lifeguard: Hey, no running on the deck!
Bart Simpson: (CALLING) I'm on the grass apron!
Lifeguard: (GRUMBLING) Everyone's a swimming pool lawyer.
(Evergreen Terrace: ext. evergreen terrace - sunset)

Marge Simpson: (FRIENDLY) Why, if it isn't Jimbo, Dorf and Ernie.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (SHY CHUCKLES) (DOLPH:) Dorf.
Marge Simpson: Bart's not home yet, but I'm always looking to encourage non-Milhouse play-dates. Stick around!
Shauna Chalmers: (WALKING UP) Hey, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Oh, it's you. (HALF-HEARTED KISSING NOISES)
Shauna Chalmers: Why do men always think with their tongue? I came to help you.
Bart Simpson: Then go back to Jimbo and show him every boob you've got.
Shauna Chalmers: (THINKS) But you told me he was a jerk and that I could do better!
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS, THEN DETERMINED:) All right. Follow me, to a place where nerds, dorks and dweebs can gather in safety.
Shauna Chalmers: This isn't, like, some creepy place under an off-ramp?
Bart Simpson: (BEAT, THEN:) Okay, we'll go to my second choice.

Comic Book Guy: Oh, that's it!
Comic Book Guy: Fellow bullies -- I've got them!
Jimbo Jones: We'll be right there.
Bart Simpson: You're a bully?
Comic Book Guy: A cyber bully. In anything I do, it's important that I can lie down while doing it.
Comic Book Guy: (PUZZLED NOISE)
Shauna Chalmers: You just got yourself in a flame war with... (OMINOUS) a teenage girl.
Comic Book Guy: Oh, flame on!

Homer Simpson: Spoiler alert! I've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: "Coconut Cream Die."
Lenny Leonard: So you don't know that Season Five was a complete wank.
Homer Simpson: (BLASTS AIR HORN) Spoiler!
Lenny Leonard: Homer, calm down. It's not like any of this stuff really took place.
Homer Simpson: (BLASTS AIR HORN) Spoil-er!
Marge Simpson: Homer, for God sakes, I'm trying to put Maggie to sleep!
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry, sweetie. (BABY TALK) It's just a Strandie discussion group. Yes it is! We discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die.
Marge Simpson: (ANGRY) You wanna know what happens on your stupid show? Firstly, the "mysterious island" is fifteen miles from Long Beach. Also, Doorway Three led to Hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to Hell, and the entire Strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!
Homer Simpson: (STUNNED) Thanks, Marge. You ruined my show. (VERY SAD) Now I'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now.
Marge Simpson: (HORRIFIED GASP)
Carl Carlson: Well, since this is a discussion group... uh, let's discuss.
Moe Szyslak: I think they're having a spat.
Lenny Leonard: I'd say it's more of a tiff.
Moe Szyslak: (OMINOUS) So I'm a moron, am I?
Homer Simpson: (HUMS BECOME CHOKED-OFF NOISE OF ALARM)
Carl Carlson: Fellas, fellas, I know where this is going. Give me all your weapons now.
Carl Carlson: Now it's time to talk about what Carl wants.
Bart Simpson: Man, they have every entrance covered. You'd have to be a Navy Seal to get in or out.
Lisa Simpson: Hello, lovebirds.
Bart Simpson: (AGGRAVATED NOISE) What are you doing here?
Lisa Simpson: I've been following your storyline from afar, Bart, waiting for that inevitable point where you get into trouble you couldn't get out of. Perhaps I could broker a settlement.
Shauna Chalmers: Well, that's my boyfriend, but he's a wad. And your brother's not a wad, he's a dink on the road to doofus.
Lisa Simpson: Hear, hear!
Jimbo Jones: The lamb has returned to the slaughter.
(Bart's Treehouse: Ext. treehouse - continuous)
DOLPH: (IMPRESSED) You should write that down, man.
Jimbo Jones: I'll remember it.
Lisa Simpson: I don't think Shauna should choose any of you. Shauna should choose Shauna.
Shauna Chalmers: Your older sister's right, Bart.
Bart Simpson: You don't want me?
Shauna Chalmers: I wanna find out who I am. And that's something only an inappropriately older man can tell me.
Bart Simpson: Well, that is one lucky creepy guy.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, are you out there in your slippers? Come inside!
Lisa Simpson: Well Bart, I guess that's our cue to skedaddle...
Jimbo Jones: Not so fast, Simpson... (TO DOLPH) What was that thing I was gonna do to him?
DOLPH: Told you you should've written it down.
Jimbo Jones: If I wrote down everything you told me to write down, I'd have no time for punching.
DOLPH: (NODS, IMPRESSED) Whoa, you should write that down, man.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - night - establishing SCENE 12)
Homer Simpson: (MUTTERING) Lousy Marge... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his TV show... I'd tell my best friend, but that's Marge too...

(Bedroom: int. bedroom - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Care to join me in a private "last episode party"?

Bart Simpson: (INTENSE) WANT!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - Master bedroom - meanwhile)
Bart Simpson: Mom, Dad, do you know there's a boat out there where nothing sucks? (QUICKLY) It's called Royalty Cruises and Royalty Cruise specialists are standing by now!
Marge Simpson: (APOLOGETIC MURMUR) I'm sorry, sweetie. Maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at "Mr. Steak."
Homer Simpson: Again with "Mr. Steak!" Do you know why I go to Mr. Steak? Because at Mr. Steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at Mr. Steak!
Marge Simpson: Well of course they don't.
Homer Simpson: Why don't you talk to Mrs. Steak?
Marge Simpson: There is no Mrs. Steak. Who could stay married to such a man.
Bart Simpson: Okay... maybe I can pay for the cruise. Let's see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck, (CLICKS) no porthole, (CLICKS) group Z lifeboat access... (HITS RETURN KEY, GROANS) It's still a ton of money.
Bart Simpson: And there's a DVD library of movies that haven't been released yet!
Lisa Simpson: Face it, we're just kids. We can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. All we have in the world are the things our parents give us.
Homer Simpson: Bart! There's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. I need you to dare me to fight him!
Homer Simpson: (SURPRISED NOISE) Bart's been raptured! And his crap's been craptured!
Milhouse Van Houten: Why do you want a box of Bart's baby teeth?
Moe Szyslak: Doctor says I need more calcium, and I ain't "Tums rich."
Moe Szyslak: (TEETH-CRUNCHING NOISES)

Marge Simpson: Just try to enjoy your dinner, sweetie.
Bart Simpson: I can't, I sold my "dinner futures."
Homer Simpson: Nice doin' business with you, boy. (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Bart Simpson: It's okay. I don't have much of an appetite tonight. ("I'M GOING TO BED") I'm going to floor.
Bart Simpson: (EXCITED) Mooooom! Daaaaaad!
Bart Simpson: I woke up and the money jar was full! That means the devil accepted my bargain. Now to uphold my end of the deal!
Bart Simpson: (CALLING, SING-SONG) Snowball II!
Marge Simpson: No. We saw how much this cruise means to you, so we all sold something special. And we made just enough for an economy cabin!
Lisa Simpson: I sold a couple of my rare jazz records. After a while they all start to sound the same. (DEFENSIVE) Still love the genre, of course. Not even close to getting sick of it.
Marge Simpson: And I sold our good china.
Bart Simpson: Really?! But that's been in your family for generations...
Marge Simpson: (GUILTY) Yeah... actually, my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for. It took her years to get the whole set.
Lisa Simpson: And Dad donated something, too.
Homer Simpson: What happened to my mini-pool table? I was training to be a mini-pool hustler.
Marge Simpson: We sold it to pay for a family cruise!
Homer Simpson: (SAD) I never even got to realize this jacket was too small.
Bart Simpson: It's weird to hear myself saying this, but... I love you guys. This is gonna be the best vacation ever!
Homer Simpson: (FLIRTY CHUCKLE) Oh, Marge... (CHUCKLES AND KISSING NOISES) your names...
Homer Simpson: Yeah, for you kids maybe. For dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! "Are you wearing enough sun block?" "Is that splashing or drowning?"
Homer Simpson: "Why does every sand castle require my participation?"
Homer Simpson: Then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...

Bart Simpson: (CATCHING HIS BREATH) The song's right! No matter how much fun I cram into this cruise...it'll only last a week. Then it's back to Mom and Dad fighting, Lisa moping, homework, bullies, and a lunchbag sandwich soggy with the sweat of a juice-box!

Passengers: (PANICKY SCREAMS) Oh no! We're stuck here!
Bart Simpson: Woo-hoo! Vacation forever!!!!!
Rowan Priddis: (CHIPPER) Good morning, everyone, as we greet a sunny Day Twelve "After Virus". While the world deals with their pandemic, we're having a "fundemic" under the capable hands of our Norwegian Captain Svalbard.
Captain Svalbard: (NORWEGIAN, SOMBER) I always knew mankind's hubris would doom us all.
Norwegian Ensign: Ja. He spoke of it often.
Rowan Priddis: Once we reach our exciting and hopefully virus-free destination, romantic Antarctica, our activities will include building shelter, hunting for food and starting civilization anew.
Rowan Priddis: While supplies may be running a little low, not to worry as today's delicious buffet features fresh seagull and hull-scraped barnacles.
Rowan Priddis: In the Chuckles Comedy Club we have Joey Scazzazone with his no-longer-observational take on our pre-Virus lives.

Homer Simpson: Worthless, worthless, worthless...
Bart Simpson: What a load of crap!
Homer Simpson: Can I put my hand through you?
Bart Simpson: Hey guys! Can you believe how awesome this is? If it wasn't for this virus thing, we'd all be back at our old sucky lives -- instead you're here, where you can be lovey-dovey all the time! Come on, kiss! Kiss!
Marge Simpson: Bart, we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, and the customer service on this cruise has really gone downhill.

Bart Simpson: But the slide's just like our cruise! A short awesome thing that just shows you how boring the rest of your life is!

Russian Businessman: You killed him, right?
Mistress: Yes -- he was the perfect lover-- (CATCHING HERSELF) of being killed!

Homer Simpson: No... not you... next... big fan but no... Cleatus the Football Robot, you're my only hope!
Homer Simpson: No one likes you!
Drug Lord: How can a fat man hide so well?
Homer Simpson: Strad, where are you?
CAIN: You can handle him, Homer. Just remember what I taught you.
Homer Simpson: When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes.
Ned Flanders: (ANGRY NOISE)
Drug Lord: I cannot kill a poet like you.
Drug Lord: (TO MARGE) And you are a very lucky woman. This is why I always say "mingle at parties." It's how I met Greg Kinnear.
DRUG LORD'S WIFE: (ENTERING, THEN "ENOUGH WITH THIS" NOISE) With the Greg Kinnear again.
Drug Lord: Can't friends talk about friends?
DRUG LORD'S WIFE: He is not your friend!
Drug Lord: Then why did he say he'd call me when he comes to Bolivia?
Homer Simpson: We used to be like them.
Marge Simpson: (ROMANTIC) So, how many more weeks do you have off?
Homer Simpson: Actually, I was supposed to be back last week. (CHUCKLES) We'll just wait for the call from human resources.
CAIN: I guess my work here is done. But Stradivarius Cain will return in: "Lisa Gets a B Plus."
Hufnpuffalus: I knew you were mad at me.

(SPRINGFIELD MUNICIPAL THEATER: int. springfield municipal theater - continuous)
Chazz Busby: Okay people, we are tryin' to depict the sizzling final days of the Nathan Lane of the New Testament -- Jesus Christ.
Chazz Busby: Now remember, this is the Passion Play, not the "Phone It In Play," not the "I Once Had Three Shows On Broadway Simultaneously But I Blew All My Money On Coke And Now Here I Am Play." So let's do this thing!
Milhouse Van Houten: (ONSTAGE) Hi, my name is Milhouse Van Houten and I am auditioning for the role of "Child Who Points."
Chazz Busby: Okay, point stage left.
Milhouse Van Houten: (PANICKED) I prepared right!
Homer Simpson: Well, I better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy.
Bart Simpson: Why do we have to audition for this stupid play and Dad gets to leave?
Homer Simpson: I already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.
Marge Simpson: Also, the passion play isn't stupid, it's the greatest story ever told!
Homer Simpson: Maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories...
Bart Simpson: "Krusty Versus the F.D.A."...
Homer Simpson: Game Six of the 2011 World Series...
Bart Simpson: "Hitler Mash-ups."
Homer Simpson: ...And Lenny's story about Cancun.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, why aren't we doing Lenny's story? That thing's hilarious.
Lenny Leonard: Not so hilarious for me. I nearly lost a toe.
Carl Carlson: That's what you get for having a monkey give you a foot massage.
Lenny Leonard: My bucket list is my business!
Chazz Busby: Next audition!
Ned Flanders: (CONFIDENT INTRODUCTORY LAUGH) Name's Ned Flanders, credits include Jesus in the passion play last year, Jesus in the passion play the year before that, Jesus, Jesus, a kindly hobo who turns out to be -- you guessed it, St. Peter...
Chazz Busby: Enough! Enough already! I'm so bored I'm ready to introduce myself to my two assistants here! You will be a "Non-speaking Pharisee"!
Ned Flanders: (SPUTTERS) But-but-but...
Chazz Busby: Jesus didn't stammer! His voice hit the back of the theater! He was a God who turned water into wine and did not wear shoes!
Homer Simpson: (HIGHLY INTRIGUED NOISE)
Chazz Busby: He said simple things that many followed.
Homer Simpson: Just like me on Twitter!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES)
Chazz Busby: And he was tragically killed while still in his thirties.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Chazz Busby: After an all-night dinner.
Homer Simpson: Woo hoo!
Homer Simpson: I'm your Jesus! Me!
Chazz Busby: Boom! Done! This guy's perfect -- you understand why God would've forsaken him!
Ned Flanders: Well, congratulations, Homer. Guess this is just my cross to bear.
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED) What's that a reference to?
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - night - establishing)
Homer Simpson: Ooh, nice and roomy. Our Lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool.
Lisa Simpson: Dad?
Homer Simpson: Yes, sweetie?
Lisa Simpson: First of all, congratulations on getting the lead.
Homer Simpson: Whee! Whee!
Lisa Simpson: I just hope you're gonna take this seriously.
Homer Simpson: Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. (QUIETLY) Whee.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, the story of the passion is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. And although I personally follow the enlightened teachings of Lord Buddha, messing with Jesus really gets people mad -- it's like wearing a Florida State jersey to a Florida game.
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED GASP)
Homer Simpson: Oh Lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders? (SOB)
Lisa Simpson: It'll be fine. Just learn your lines.
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Does Jesus have a big part in this thing?
Lisa Simpson: He's in every scene.

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (SOMBERLY NARRATING) And so, our Lord was brought before Pontius Pilate.
Chief Wiggum: What's he in for?
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (GRAVE) He calls himself "King of the Jews."
Chief Wiggum: Hoo boy! (TO HOMER) Okay, be straight with me -- you can probably plead this down to crucifixion. Do you call yourself "King of the Jews?"
Homer Simpson: Thou sayest it!
Krusty the Clown: (POINTS) He's good.
Professor Jonathan Frink: I'm so moved, I renounce science... with the facts, and the peer reviews, and the hypotheses tested by evidence.
Chief Wiggum: (TO MOB) What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?
Angry Mob: Crucify him!
Homer Simpson: (DRAMATIC) They cannot judge me. (LOOKS HEAVENWARD) Only my Father can judge me.
Grampa Simpson: Crucify him!
Homer Simpson: (FURIOUS) I'll take you with me, old man!
Homer Simpson: Mmm, historically inaccurate.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Jesus was handed a heavy cross, and upon his brow was placed a crown...

Women: (ANGUISHED WAILS)
Homer Simpson: (KINDLY) Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves.

Jimbo Jones: Silence, Pharisee!
Sideshow Mel: Looks like someone didn't follow the underwear rule.
Snake Jailbird: This man is totally the son of God.
Homer Simpson: (DRAMATIC, IMPRESSIVE) Tonight, you shall be at my right hand in Heaven.
Snake Jailbird: All right! It pays to network at these things!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
Homer Simpson: (NOISE OF GREAT ANGUISH)
Ned Flanders: Lord, forgive me for my pride. All-wise, as always, you have rightly raised Homer above me.
Ned Flanders: Never again will I question...

Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: I mean I envy Flanders, once again enjoying the joys of marriage. Let's put it to a vote, America.
Marge Simpson: Enough with the voting. Ned, Edna, why didn't you tell us?

Ned Flanders: (FIRMLY) Boys, you will please call your new mother whatever she feels comfortable with.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: How 'bout "Edna?"
Todd Flanders: It's disrespectful to call a grownup by their first name.
Bart Simpson: Yo, Homer! Mom says get your fat ass over to the Flanders'!
Homer Simpson: Bart! Don't call me that!
Bart Simpson: Which one? Homer or fat ass?
Homer Simpson: Why you little... they're both bad, and I suspect you know it!

(Flanders Home: Int. flanders house - the present)
Ned Flanders: Okay Simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun.

Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Okay, there's no school, your Dad's at work and it's really comin' down. Anyone for Scrabble?

Marge Simpson: Why does that make him right?
Homer Simpson: He took the time to press the shift key, Marge! I think he knows what he's talking about.
Ned Flanders: (TO EDNA) You get my boys tattoos, you change their school, you buy Rod sneakers that light up like Times Square...shoes are shoes and lights are lights! Now, just when do I get a say in how my boys are raised?! (FURIOUS) This marriage isn't perfect!
Marge Simpson: No video... party over... caaaake!
Helen Lovejoy: Too late, Marge.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Ned, these boys trust me to be their mother. You'd better decide whether you do.
Moe Szyslak: And that's that. Another story in the classic, infallible three-act structure. Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for the Simpsons.

Marge Simpson: That is totally irresponsible parenting!
Homer Simpson: Not according to the internet!
Marge Simpson: Where on the internet?
Homer Simpson: I'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
Marge Simpson: Why would you believe him?
Homer Simpson: Because his avatar is Darth Maul! The second-coolest Darth!
Homer Simpson: And what he says is true because it's in all caps. Are you gonna argue with caps?
Ned Flanders: So after all this time together, you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?
Marge Simpson: Ned, I realized long ago, there are some things Homer and I will never completely agree on.
Homer Simpson: (GENIAL) Yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry.
Marge Simpson: It's angry.
Homer Simpson: Don't tell me what our thing is.
Marge Simpson: It's about not agreeing on something.

Lisa Simpson: (CONCERNED) Um, can I be excused from holding up my end of the conversation?
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO TO BART, RE: LISA) What's wrong with her?
Bart Simpson: She just found out no one likes her. (LOUD WHISPER) I thought she knew!
Milhouse Van Houten: Hey, Lisa! Maybe you'd feel a little better if you read the Daily Fourth Gradian message board, huh? (WAGGLES EYEBROWS)
Lisa Simpson: (READS BOARDS) Let's see... "Uncensored Jump-rope Chants"... (DREADING) Oh, there's a whole thread labeled "Lisa Simpson!" (READS, THEN PUZZLED NOISE)
Bart Simpson: Ay carumba! Somebody's actually on your side!
Bart Simpson: (READING) "Lisa doesn't judge other people. Why should we judge her?" It's signed, "Truth Teller."
Marge Simpson: Whoever this "Truth Teller" is, I'm a fan. It takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously.
Lisa Simpson: (ACTING SUSPICIOUS) Y'know, it seems like more than a coincidence that Milhouse brought it to our attention.
Milhouse Van Houten: (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Well, I certainly wish I was Truth Teller. But if I was, you'd know, because I can't keep a secret. (BLURTING QUICKLY) I sleep under my bed every night 'cause I'm scared of the cars from "Cars" -- if gasoline is their food then why do they have teeth?!

Terri Mackleberry: Double Dutch.
Lisa Simpson: (SMALL HAPPY SOB) Forgive a fool her tears.
Bart Simpson: Hey Lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at Flesh-In-The-Pan Pizza, and wanted me to invite you.
Lisa Simpson: Fifth-graders? Ooh-la-la! They get to put their desks in a circle!
Bart Simpson: And read books where the parents are divorced. That joint is jumpin'.
Lisa Simpson: So, when's the party?
Bart Simpson: (READING) "Lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection."
Lisa Simpson: (AGHAST) That's mine!
Bart Simpson: This notebook is full of things Truth Teller said!
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) Give that back!
Bart Simpson: This one says "post next Friday." (GASP) Oh my God! You're Truth Teller!

Marge Simpson: Now sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this. I stopped reading after "TOP STUDENT".
Homer Simpson: You wanna honk your jazz tube?
Lisa Simpson: (SAD MURMUR) What is the point? I think this is the end of me. All I had was my integrity. And now that's gone. (SOBS) I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I try not to cry till you're asleep.
Homer Simpson: I appreciate that.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED MURMUR)
Lisa Simpson: (SOBBING) Look, if I could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, I think I might have a chance to...
Homer Simpson: Hey, why don't we go see Lady Gaga? That'll turn your frown upside down.
Lisa Simpson: It's not a frown. It is a straight line of resignation. Looks just the same upside down.
Homer Simpson: (INTRIGUED) What are you talking about? Y-you're right!
Homer Simpson: Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, if you really wanna help, please stop trying to help.

Lady Gaga: What sweater drawer did you crawl out of?
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you. Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm.
Lady Gaga: But all I'm saying is that everyone is beautiful--
Marge Simpson: I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
Ned Flanders: Yes, but Jesus said that... pretty much the same thing. Darnit, the Bible said the Devil would be attractive!

Lady Gaga: Sorry, gotta answer this text.
Lisa Simpson: (GLUM) Please, take your time.
Lady Gaga: You know what you need?
Lisa Simpson: (HOPEFUL) Solitude?
Lady Gaga: Flash mob.
Lady Gaga: Now, Lisa, if that didn't fundamentally change who you are, I don't know what.
Just Stamp the Ticket Man: You idiots! She meant we should disperse.
Lady Gaga: Lisa, you un-tattooed little miracle, I'm not leaving here until I restore your sense of hope.
Lady Gaga: (BEAT) Come on, say something.
Lisa Simpson: Let me explain. I have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if I give up hope. Now if you don't mind, and with all due worship, I would like to be alone.
Bart Simpson: Lady Gaga, meet your biggest threat: Baby Googoo.
Lisa Simpson: (MUFFLED) Can I please be alone?
Lisa Simpson: Well, it worked once.
Lady Gaga: So, any ideas about Lisa?
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) I never have any idea what to do for Lisa. To be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument (SOTTO) I don't really care for. (STARTING TO SOB) It's so hard.
Marge Simpson: I wish I was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, 'cause it doesn't work for me.

Lisa Simpson: (SNAPPING) Why do you keep telling me what I'm gonna do? This isn't about me.
Lady Gaga: Well, who else would it be about?
Lisa Simpson: You! It's about (IMITATING GAGA) Hello, hello, Springfield. It's me, Gaga! Why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds?
Lisa Simpson: Well, I denounce thee!
Lady Gaga: Wha?!
Lisa Simpson: I denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill! And I denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!

Homer Simpson: Lisa, can you come down?
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS)
(Bart's Treehouse: Ext. treehouse - a little later)
Homer Simpson: Sweetie, I've been thinking. Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. The problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught.
Homer Simpson: I cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. So, honey, what do you say?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, thank you. Like always, the fact that I could tune you out without fearing I'd miss out on something, gave me the time to take stock, and realize how ungrateful I have been. Which means I've got a train to catch.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right.

Lisa Simpson: Gaga!
Lady Gaga: Lisa?
Lady Gaga: Why are you here?
Lisa Simpson: To thank you!
Lady Gaga: For what?
Lisa Simpson: Look at me! You did help me, by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you. It was like a great sneeze. And now I can say what's good about me. And I can say it as Lisa Simpson! (MUCH SOFTER) Just not that loud.
Lady Gaga: Go ahead.
Lisa Simpson: (QUICKLY, QUIETLY) Well, I'm smart, nice, tolerant, funny but not "mean funny," and I never forget a birthday, even for kids who move away.
Lady Gaga: Now Lisa, there's only one last thing you have to do to be a Little Monster!
Lisa Simpson: I'll do anything but sing!
Lady Gaga: You're gonna sing!

Milhouse Van Houten: She never doesn't do what she's supposed to! This is major!
Bart Simpson: (ROLLING EYES) Fine. We'll follow her.
Otto Mann: Well if they're not taking the bus, neither am I.
Ralph Wiggum: I'm going to a accident!
Milhouse Van Houten: Lisa's taking a cab? I'm worried. Does she even know how much to tip?
Milhouse Van Houten: What's it say?
Bart Simpson: (READING) "The five boxing wizards jump quickly?" (INTRIGUED) Whoa! My sister's finally become... mildly interesting!
Milhouse Van Houten: Sounds like a case for the "Detecti-pals." (EAGER) Taxi!
Milhouse Van Houten: (BUMMED) They never stop for blue-heads.
(Car Dealership: ext. car dealership - day)
Stan: (SMOOTH) Hello ma'am. Are you and your husband here to look for a new car?
Marge Simpson: No, I'm here to buy one myself.
Stan: Uh-huh.
Stan: Well, I think the Tissan Sensibla is the car for you.
Stan: It's got all the features that a modern woman wants, including all manner of makeup mirrors.
Marge Simpson: This car looks a little small. Is the engine powerful?
Stan: (ACTS IMPRESSED) Wow, somebody knows her cars.
Stan: (SMOOTH) This baby comes with an RX-12 2-cylinder!
Marge Simpson: Well, that's odd, because the consumer website says the RX-12 2-cylinder has a dealer's invoice of fourteen seven.
Stan: (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna talk to my manager.
Marge Simpson: (RE: SMARTPHONE) This says you are the manager.
Stan: Those websites are taking food out of my children's mouths!
Marge Simpson: It says on your Facebook page you have no kids.
Stan: (SNAPPING) I have two Yorkies, and I'll be talking about you, to them, tonight!

Marge Simpson: Uh-oh! Do you hear that rattle?
Bart Simpson: I don't hear anything.
Lisa Simpson: Me neither.
Marge Simpson: And what's that smell?

(AUTO DEALERSHIP: ext. auto dealership - garage - day)
Marge Simpson: (IRATE) ...the wipers wipe backwards, and the defroster lines on the back window are too close together! Excuse me.
Mechanic: Sir, the car is fine. Can I be straight with you? As a mechanic, I'm not totally qualified to judge mental health...
Homer Simpson: So, you're not totally unqualified.
Mechanic: I think the problem is in your wife's head. There's a psychological reason why she hates this car.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) A reason? What could it be?
Seymour Skinner: What fun!
Mechanic: I'm sorry, but there's no diagnostic computer for the female mind.
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth.
Mechanic: If you want me to examine your wife overnight I can arrange a loaner.
Mechanic: She's an '83 Yugo.
Woman: (YUGOSLAVIAN ACCENT) I don't do laundry or kiss boo-boos!
Homer Simpson: Umm... no thanks.
(Evergreen Terrace: ext. evergreen terrace - that night)
Homer Simpson: (TENTATIVE) Marge... do you think maybe there's another reason you don't like this car? Um... um... a "feelings" reason?
Marge Simpson: (SKEPTICAL/ANNOYED) What are you talking about?
Homer Simpson: Well, maybe you and the car got off on the wrong foot. When do you think things first went wrong?
Marge Simpson: (HUMORING HIM) All right, I remember we all got in... and by the way, that backseat is pretty tight for the kids. I mean, I don't know what we'd do if we had another baby. (GROWING REALIZATION) With this car, we're basically saying no more babies!
Homer Simpson: No, no, Marge. I want you to explore your feelings.
Marge Simpson: Homer, the reason I hate this car is... I think I want another baby!
Homer Simpson: An "on purpose" baby?
Marge Simpson: (REALIZING) I do!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - night - moments later)
Marge Simpson: (SWEETLY) Homie, I want another baby.
Homer Simpson: What about... you know... "Stinky"?
Marge Simpson: Maggie's not a baby! Her soft spot's been skulled over for the last three months! (SWEETLY) Being a mom is who I am, and I'm not done being who I am.
Homer Simpson: (WHISTLES)
Homer Simpson: (WHISTLES)
Homer Simpson: (PLAYING IT COOL) Whatever you want, sweetie.
Marge Simpson: Well, take a shower, 'cause we're gonna try it tonight!
Marge Simpson: Homer, why do you take a three second pause before you answer what I say?
Homer Simpson: (TWO SECOND PAUSE) Just appreciating (TWO SECOND PAUSE) how lucky (TWO SECOND PAUSE) I am to be (TWO SECOND PAUSE) with (TWO SECOND PAUSE) you.
Marge Simpson: What a wonderful thought.
Bart Simpson: Boxing wizards. Boxing wizards. What's she up to?
Evil Wizard: (HISSES) Let's settle this like adults. Wands down!
Bart Simpson: Maybe I should go on anti-psychotic meds.
Lisa Simpson: (ANNOYED) Bart! What are you doing in my room?!
Bart Simpson: Lowering your blinds. I'd hate for your carpet to fade.
Bart Simpson: (BLURTS) What are you doing Tuesdays and Thursdays after school?
Lisa Simpson: What do you do Tuesdays and Thursdays after school?
Bart Simpson: Write stupid stuff on the chalkboard. And if you have any ideas, I'm really running out. Today's was "mousetraps are not slippers" or something. Now what are you up to?
Lisa Simpson: A gentleman doesn't ask and a lady doesn't tell.
Bart Simpson: Can I use that on the chalkboard?
Lisa Simpson: I guess.
Bart Simpson: (INTO RECORDER) Gentleman doesn't ask, lady doesn't tell. Now all I need is one for Martin Luther King Day.
(Dr. Hibbert's Office: int. dr. hibbert's office - day)
Marge Simpson: (SHYLY) My husband and I have been snuggling six ways from Sunday...
Homer Simpson: And let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight.
Marge Simpson: ...but we aren't making a baby. I thought we should check, to make sure Homer has... you know, working stunt-men in his cannon.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: You were wise to check, Marge.
Marge Simpson: What do you mean?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLES, GRIM:) Take a look at this.
Homer Simpson: (GRAVELY) X's for eyes...
Marge Simpson: (SADLY) I guess... that's that, then.
Homer Simpson: Honey, I am so sorry. I guess we'll just have to learn to love the three children we have.
Marge Simpson: (SAD MURMUR)
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - backyard - treehouse - establishing)
Homer Simpson: (GETTING IDEA NOISE) Hey, uh... hm... why don't we take the longer but nicer historic route? Then today will be nothing but beautiful memories.
Bart Simpson: Lisa's going somewhere after school two days a week. And all we have are boxing wizards. If we're gonna find out what Lisa's up to, I'll need the help of all her old boyfriends.
Milhouse Van Houten: Guess we've all carried the same books, huh, guys?
Nelson Muntz: (SCOFFING) She carried mine.
Milhouse Van Houten: This just became a treehouse of horrors!
Milhouse Van Houten: (FALLING NOISE, THEN:) It's okay! I landed on a mattress!
(Springfield Streets: ext. springfield streets - later)
Milhouse Van Houten: Whatever it is, she's in over her head.
Bart Simpson: Way over. We gotta save that poor girl. (LOOKS AROUND) Anyone know how we get home?
Nelson Muntz: We got bigger problems! (POINTING) It's Father Mike!
(Moe's Tavern: ext. moe's tavern - later that night)
Marge Simpson: I can't believe we're never going to have another child... (SNIFFLES)
Lenny Leonard: Is everything okay over here?
Homer Simpson: Sorry guys. Private family moment.
Marge Simpson: (TIPSY) No, s'okay. We can share this with you... Homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers.
Lenny Leonard: (SYMPATHETIC) Aw, that's a shame.
Carl Carlson: (NODS) Yeah. That's why I wrap my plums in tin foil every day.
Homer Simpson: (PHILOSOPHIC) Eh, nothing we can do.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer... what if you got back one of those samples you sold years ago at the Shelbyville Sperm Bank?
Marge Simpson: (STUNNED) You never told me about that.
Homer Simpson: (ADMITTING) It's true... that's how I got the money to buy you your necklace.
Marge Simpson: Awww... (THEN) Eww... (REALIZING) Homie! We still have a chance!
Homer Simpson: I, uh, hope it's twins!
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
(Highway: ext. highway - later)
Marge Simpson: Now I'm thinking Alex if it's a girl and Xander if it's a boy.
Marge Simpson: (SHRUGS) Okay.
(Car: Ext. car - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Watch it!
Marge Simpson: (SEEING SOMETHING) Ooh, a Christmas ornament museum! Can we stop?
Homer Simpson: (MOCK WARNING) Okay, but just for a minute. We want to hit the candle store, Fudgerama, the Zipper Hall of Fame, Snow Globe World, and The Taj Meatball.
Marge Simpson: I think that Shiva used to be Paul Bunyan.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - day)
Nelson Muntz: What's "Detention" doing here?
Seymour Skinner: I need to know what's up with Lisa. If her grades drop, we're not technically a school -- we're a tornado shelter with voting booths.
Seymour Skinner: Nothing exceptional here. (INTRIGUED) Except -- blue reinforcements.
Seymour Skinner: Only one person I've ever known uses these: my predecessor, Principal Meredith Milgram.
Boys: (GASP)
Seymour Skinner: Follow me, but be warned: there's no permission slip for what we're doing.
(CRAFTSMAN BUNGALOW: ext. craftsman bungalow - later)
Meredith Milgram: A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats.
Milhouse Van Houten: That's about three more jeopardized gunboats than I'd expect.
Seymour Skinner: Thank God we brought the bus driver.
Meredith Milgram: (STRICT, BUT POLITE) Seymour, what are you doing here?
Seymour Skinner: Taking four children across town to investigate a piece of paper we found on the ground.
Meredith Milgram: Don't you have better things to do?
Seymour Skinner: Sadly, no.
Meredith Milgram: Same ol' Seymour.
Lisa Simpson: I know why they're here!
Lisa Simpson: Because they can't let me have a secret. It drives them crazy.
Lisa Simpson: Cursive writing. I'm learning cursive. (POINTS TO PAPER) All these sentences have every letter of the alphabet in them.
Otto Mann: Ooh, don't they teach them fancy squiggles at school?
Seymour Skinner: Uh, we do not. Outmoded, no room in the budget, and all the teachers forgot how to make a capital "Q."
Meredith Milgram: Two loops and a flourish. Luckily, a few brave students still want to learn.
Lisa Simpson: I hope you're happy. You all just wasted your time working your way into an afterschool class.
Ralph Wiggum: (TERRIFIED NOISE)
(Museum of Christmas Ornaments: ext. museum of christmas ornaments - sunset)
Marge Simpson: (SMALL DISAPPOINTED NOISE) I can't believe we spent the whole day here.
Homer Simpson: (SECRETLY PLEASED, CHUCKLES) And I got to try every flavor of candy cane: white and red.
Marge Simpson: (CHECKS WATCH) Well, maybe we should check into a motel.
(IGLOO MOTOR LODGE: int. igloo motor lodge - room - later)
Marge Simpson: (KISSING NOISES) Ooh, Homie, you've lost weight.
Homer Simpson: What's that, baby?
Marge Simpson: (WEIRDED-OUT NOISE)
Homer Simpson: I'll take it from here, wing-man.
Marge Simpson: (SMITTEN) It sure was nice to have a day together as a couple.
Homer Simpson: (DROWSY) Yeah, no kids to ruin it.
Marge Simpson: (SUDDENLY STERN) I thought the whole point of this trip was to have another baby.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda.
Marge Simpson: So, you don't want another baby? How long have you felt this way?
Homer Simpson: Uh, well, looking back, I guess it started sometime before Bart was born.
Homer Simpson: (SAD) Room for one, please.
(ROUTE 33: ext. route 33 - morning)
(MARGE'S HATCHBACK: int. marge's hatchback - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids.
Homer Simpson: Emotionally, financially, the boy... I just didn't know how to tell you.
Marge Simpson: Just yell across the house like you do everything else!
Homer Simpson: Okay, good, we're talking...
Marge Simpson: We're not talking!
Homer Simpson: Your phone just dialed me.
Marge Simpson: You were pocket-dialed!
Homer Simpson: Hey, the pocket wants what it wants.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED NOISE)
(REST STOP: ext. rest stop - a little later)
Homer Simpson: (ATTEMPTING CONVERSATION) They just leave the maple syrup on the table, huh? How about that? That's trust, huh?
Marge Simpson: Shush!
Dad: (CHUCKLES) Now kids, help your brother Xander.
Dad: Where's daddy? Where'd daddy go?
Dad: Here he is!
(Shelbyville: ext. Shelbyville - street - later that day)
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Uh-oh. I don't think I rewound the video the last time I was here.
(FERTILITY CLINIC: int. fertility clinic - MOMENTS LATER)
Homer Simpson: Um, I'd like to get back a donation made fifteen years ago by a Simpson, Homer. Or it may be under the name Thad Supersperm.
Marge Simpson: Homer... Homer, this is the point where I really have to know what you want.
Homer Simpson: I'll tell you what I want, Marge. I want to make another Simpson. The table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. Cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. And anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect.
Marge Simpson: (VERY TOUCHED NOISE)
Receptionist: Nice speech, but the last of your sample was just selected by another couple.
Homer Simpson: Are you sure there isn't more? I mean there's always a little ketchup left in the bottle.
Receptionist: I'm afraid not. But the couple is waiting in the room there. Maybe you can talk them into something else.
(Waiting Room: ext. waiting room - continuous)
Husband: (SHOCKED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: I'd like to buy back my sample.
Wife: Are you saying... our sample came from you?
Husband: (QUICKLY) Here, it's yours. We don't need it.
Homer Simpson: Well, I expected a little argument.
Husband: No, no, no, look in the mirror, that's your argument.
Homer Simpson: (FEELINGS HURT) Geez. I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman, but I'm all right.
(FERTILITY CLINIC: Int. fertility clinic - later)
Marge Simpson: (STUNNED GASP)
Marge Simpson: Homer? How many samples did you sell?
Homer Simpson: Um... remember that Corvette I had?
Marge Simpson: I thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM OF PAIN) This is the worst pain imaginable! (EATS ONION RING, SCREAM OF PAIN)
Homer Simpson: (WALKING UP) Exactly. Well, we're all set. Let's make a Thad Supersperm Junior. With a name like that, he could be president.
Marge Simpson: Homie, maybe we should wait.
Homer Simpson: (VERY SURPRISED NOISE)
Marge Simpson: Maybe there's enough Homer in the world for now.
Homer Simpson: (GENUINELY DISAPPOINTED) But I was really looking forward to...
Homer Simpson: (REACTION NOISE, THEN:) You're right, Marge. I don't wanna bring more kids into a world full of my kids. (DISGUSTED NOISE)

Thought Bubble Dr. Hibbert: Eat healthier!
THOUGHT BUBBLE BERNICE: You too, Julius! I heard you were at Loretta's Diner on "Catfish Friday!"
Thought Bubble Dr. Hibbert: How do you know that? You got your brother following me?
THOUGHT BUBBLE BERNICE: Chester needs a job.
Thought Bubble Dr. Hibbert: I paid him to build a shed! Where is my shed, Bernice?

Roberto Dinero: Money? What I am concerned about is your burns.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED NOISE)

Roberto Dinero: Yes, these are special acid markers.
(Courtroom: Int. courtroom - continuous)
Judge Snyder: Homer Simpson, you shall receive five-thousand dollars after legal fees.

(Moe's Tavern: ext. moe's - establishing)
Carl Carlson: So, uh, what are you gonna do with the money, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Well, thought bubble Marge said we should put it in a college fund for Lisa.
Lenny Leonard: So where's the money now?
Homer Simpson: I put it in the bank. That place is great! On their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up.
Carl Carlson: Uh, Homer, we all wanna walk on the beach with our pants rolled up, but, uh, banks are not as safe as they used to be.
Lenny Leonard: Yeah, when you give the bank your money, they lend it to other people! I saw a Sesame Street about it! Kermit was wearing his trench coat and everything!
Homer Simpson: Wait, the frog in the trench coat is Kermit too?
Lenny Leonard: All the frogs on that show are Kermit. Keeps all the other frog actors out of work.
Homer Simpson: That settles it. No banks for me.
Moe Szyslak: I'll tell you where you should put your money. The one safe place left in this world of woe:
Homer Simpson: What the--? I'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS)
(Springfield Retirement Castle: Ext. Springfield retirement castle - day - establishing)
Moe Szyslak: Nah, you don't have to bet the money. The poker website just keeps it nice and safe, where the FDIC can't get its grubby little hands on it!
Homer Simpson: A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?
Moe Szyslak: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't you badmouth this country. Compared to the rest of the third world, we're doin' great!
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - DINING room - day)

Lisa Simpson: More importantly it's a college fund...
Homer Simpson: (MORE UPBEAT) On a poker site!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, please!
Homer Simpson: Sorry. Check out my new t-shirt.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Where'd you get that shirt?
Homer Simpson: I've had it for a long time. I was just about to throw it out, and then this happened.
Homer Simpson: That's one way to avoid drunk driving.
Marge Simpson: Another way is don't drink.
Homer Simpson: I'm not Superman.
Marge Simpson: Homie! Do you know what yesterday was?
Homer Simpson: Ha, of course I do! (THINKS, THEN SEARCHING) Happy anni... birth... entine... shark week?
Marge Simpson: Yesterday's the day we were supposed to visit Grampa!

(Springfield Streets: EXT. SPRINGFIELD STREETS - DAY)
Homer Simpson: Okay, remember the plan. Apologize to Grampa. Then when he wants us to take him out to lunch, point to the leftovers, tell him we already did, but he forgot.
Marge Simpson: I still feel guilty. Your father's not going to be around forever.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you take that back!
Marge Simpson: Fine, he'll be around forever.
Homer Simpson: You take that back!
Homer Simpson: (SIGHS) We're here to see Abe Simpson.
Female Orderly: (CONCERNED) Abe Simpson?! Uh, excuse me.
Male Orderly: I'm very sorry to tell you your father... is missing.
Homer Simpson: Missing?! What kind of a prison are you people running here?

Lisa Simpson: Get your hands off my future!
Bart Simpson: Fine, fine.
Lisa Simpson: (TO SELF) New low, even for this family... college fund on a poker site... I'm just gonna log right out.
Lisa Simpson: Get outta here!
Lisa Simpson: (NOTICES) Huh. Two queens. That's a great start.
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Well, maybe I can just win the sixty-two dollars back.
Lisa Simpson: Four queens! Yes! Yes!!!
Ned Flanders: Gambling, eh? Satan's most potent recruiting tool!
Lisa Simpson: All due respect, Mr. Flanders, could I have a little privacy?
Lisa Simpson: Please? Thank you.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah! Fifty dollars up! (CONFIDENT LAUGH) Time to play with house money!
Bart Simpson: Or, time to walk away from the table.

Homer Simpson: (QUICKLY) Or a spy from a rival gang! (TERRIFIED) Hey, what are you doin'? (PAINED NOISES)
Bartender: (GREEK) Abe Simpson -- used to work here. (COMMANDING) Put him down!
Bartender: Welcome to Spiro's! I am Spiro. Not the Spiro on the sign -- that's my brother.
Homer Simpson: (GETTING UP) Did you say my dad worked here?
Spiro: Yes. (NOSTALGIC) In the old days. When people ate steak, drank champagne, and the music... oh, the music! (FURIOUS) I hated the music!
YOUNG SPIRO: Simpson! I pay you to clean tables, not to write songs. And you, Marvin Hamlisch, I pay you to write songs, not to clean tables!
Marvin Hamlisch: What can I say? I like to pitch in.
Spiro: Napas To Thailo Valka!
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute!
Homer Simpson: My dad was an aspiring songwriter like Charles Manson? I never knew that.

YOUNG RITA: Hey, you can't do that! I just turned sweet on him! Yeah!
YOUNG SPIRO: Be sweet on him on your own sweet time! (TO SELF) Why did I ever leave Greece? (RECALLS) Oh that's right, 'cause it's a train wreck.
RITA: I understand. But this is hard. Yeah.
Spiro: (REMORSEFUL) I never saw either of them again. If you find your Dad, tell him "sorry" from Spiro Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
Marge Simpson: Got it. (SMOOTHLY) Papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
Homer Simpson: Now, what was that singer's name again?

Bart Simpson: I'm Sideshow Bob!
Bart Simpson: I've been using his avatar to play poker and trash his favorite restaurants on Yelp.
Bart Simpson: And I saved your vegetarian bacon.

Grampa Simpson: I didn't wander off, ya big fat salami! I ran away!
Homer Simpson: (SHOCKED) What?!
Grampa Simpson: You think I'm boring, and you never visit me, and I got sick of waitin' for ya! So I got a job and found a new dump to live in and I didn't tell you about it, so at least that way I know you're not coming!
Marge Simpson: Grampa, we will never miss a visit again. And there'll be a lot more of them.
Homer Simpson: And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. Look at Sunday night. There's like eight amazing shows. None of them on Fox.

Baseball Announcer: We're back...
Barney Blimp: (BELCH)
Baseball Announcer: The pitcher, Steroid Santa Claus...kicks and deals. It's a long fly ball! Going back! Back!
Baseball Announcer: And the ball shatters the sky, bringing the ocean itself down into the stadium! Simpson just broke this dream's reality wide open!
Baseball Announcer: The groundskeepers are trying to put on the tarp, but it turned into a manta ray and stung 'em all. Now we'll be right back after this word from oxygen, which Homer desperately needs to live.

Homer Simpson: I'm in an abusive relationship with life. It keeps beating the hell out of me, and I'm too cowardly to leave it. (SIGHS) Maybe I could drink myself to death.
Moe Szyslak: Eh, well, you can't. Your tolerance is too high.
Dejected Barfly: (A LITTLE SLURRED) Man, I've never seen Homer looking this bad.
Moe Szyslak: (LOOKING AT HOMER) You're right. He needs some professional help...
Duffman: Ooh, someone is down in the Duff!
Homer Simpson: (SAD) Life is too fragile. One minute you're lying in your hammock drinkin' beer, the next thing you know you're sittin' here drinkin' beer.
Duffman: Homer, your bleak outlook has sent a smooth, icy chill down... (DROPPING CHARACTER) Screw it, I quit.
Duffman: (TO DUFF GIRLS) Janette, Cheryl, get your own ride home.
Homer Simpson: Aw, come on Chief, I've had a rotten day. Can't you help me out?

Homer Simpson: Which of you is the YouTube of the kid high on dentist's gas? Is it you? Is it you? (EXTREMELY CHOKED-UP, ALMOST A WHISPER) Is it you?
Homer Simpson: Oh Lord, when things looked darkest, you gave me light. Then you switched it off knowing full well I had declined thy infernal Mapple Care. Please grant me the wisdom to understand your capricious, nasty mind. And please, please make the next swing of the yo-yo an up, amen.

Ned Flanders: Here it is. The Holy Ooze.
Homer Simpson: This is your miracle? A tree? (GESTICULATING WITH FINGERS) Ooh, look at me. I turn sunlight into complex sugars. Big whoop.
Ned Flanders: Look a little closer.
Homer Simpson: Huh. "Hope." Is this one of those coincidences like Jesus on a tortilla or George Washington on a dollar bill?
Marge Simpson: Well... I like that its message is in sap and not in blood... like some miracles I could mention. (COUGHS) Passover.
Homer Simpson: Well, this is how God would send me a message. In my back yard, hammock adjacent, in one short word in large print. What do you think he's trying to tell me, Flanders?
Ned Flanders: Well, sir, if you ask me, somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires you've got in your life, God's there, with His little spare, that enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station.
Ned Flanders: Don't eat the miracle!
Homer Simpson: Fine. I'll just go eat the body of God. That's not crazy.
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - day)

Kent Brockman: As you can see here, a shadowy figure emerges from the darkness and walks up to the tree in the Simpsons' backyard... if we freeze and zoom in on the image, we clearly see the figure holding a syrup bottle, with which he writes the word "hope."
Kent Brockman: (TO CAMERA, CONDESCENDING) Supermarket maple syrup. It was no miraculous tree of God... and there is no hope on Evergreen Terrace, just a run-of-the-mill syrup-spraying mystery man. We can add this to the list of... (DRAMATIC, JABBING FINGER AT CAMERA) Kent's Closed Cases.

Homer Simpson: I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe it's time to call Satan. (PULLS OUT CELL PHONE) Is that a two-one-two?
Marge Simpson: Don't call Satan! So what if the message wasn't a miracle? The answer isn't in syrup from God or a computer tablet, the answer is that the hope you felt was real.
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Marge, up to now I thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now I know it's a solid loaf of brain.
Marge Simpson: (FLATTERED) Homie, you have such a way with foods. (SWEETLY) Let's go inside.

Marge Simpson: The kids are a mess! You brought them home exhausted and pretentious!
Homer Simpson: No, we need to take kids to grownup stuff. That's Terence's parenting style--
Marge Simpson: Parenting shouldn't have a style! Parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on! (NOTICING SOMETHING) Are you wearing a wallet chain?! You look like... a barista!
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) Well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches.
Marge Simpson: And what's with the scarf? It's soaked in neck sweat.

Homer Simpson: Oh man, my goatee has barely come in. Why does my hair only grow in twos?
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) I hope T-Rex likes the present I made him.
Marge Simpson: Made? Why didn't you just buy him a toy?
Homer Simpson: (SIGHS) Homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. If I show up with a "toy" from the "store," like we would give "our kids," then I've failed! And these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!
(Abandoned Factory: Int. abandoned factory - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Geez, is this a kid's birthday party or the place a bad guy kidnaps you to in a movie?
Terence: Yeah, this factory used to make blimp tires.

T-Rex: (SCOFFS) I used to. Now I'm into abandoned ethnic union halls.
Bart Simpson: Come on dude, this party rocks! Love the temporary tattoo station!
T-Rex: (SCOFFS) Uh, temporary?

Nursing Women: A bottle! / Plastic! / Formula!
Nursing Toddler: That is so wrong!
Marge Simpson: Fine! I admit it, you... nipple Nazis! I give my baby formula!
Nursing Women: (APPALLED GASP)

T-Rex: "Dino-Cool." Oh, I get it -- a T-Rex for the T-Rex. How long did it take him to think of that one?
Bart Simpson: (ANNOYED) Hey! My dad worked really hard to make that. He took a class to learn denim painting!
T-Rex: (SCOFFS) This is so pathetic I can't even wear it ironically ironically.
Bart Simpson: No one bad-mouths my dad except me!
Terence: Your son attacked mine! You've turned this former slaughterhouse into a place of violence!
Homer Simpson: I thought it made blimp tires!

Bart Simpson: Have you been "oh boy"-ing all night?
Homer Simpson: O-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... We had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up.
Bart Simpson: Look. That kid threw your present in the garbage, and he called you a poser and everyone laughed!
Homer Simpson: He called me... a poser?
Bart Simpson: (GENUINE) Yeah, I was sticking up for you.
Homer Simpson: You? Sticking up for your old man? You've never done that before.
Marge Simpson: Also, I didn't want to tell you, but... that wife and her gang looked down on me because I don't breastfeed!
Homer Simpson: What? (GROWING ANGRY) No one judges my wife's thunderbags! Well maybe I was wrong about these people. Who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
Homer Simpson: They can ("GO TO") goatee... hell!
Homer Simpson: Yeah, that's right, the friendship between the Simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over!

Terence: I like him. He talks in rhyme and owns a whimsical store in a failing mall. He's like the dad in a Wes Anderson movie.
Homer Simpson: Shut up with your names!
Emily: Well, we were just questioning the parenting that led to Bart not using his words with Tyrannosaurus.
Homer Simpson: Parenting? (HUFF NOISE) Let me tell you "cool parents" something. Parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! It's nature's way!
Marge Simpson: (BLURTING) When you're old, your tattoos will be saggy and illegible!
Emily: (POINTED) Well, at least I don't put a corporate chemical cocktail into my child's body!
Marge Simpson: See, see what I'm dealing with here, Ned? We invited them here, and they repay us with insults and judgments.
Ned Flanders: Yes, but there's two sides to every--
Homer Simpson: Even Flanders agrees! This is our neighborhood. We were here first, so you should leave.
Emily: We're not going anywhere. (HOLDS UP MYPAD) Our house just got written up in "Dwell."

Bart Simpson: Why do you think everything's lame?

Homer Simpson: Oh my God, Dad... I owe you an apology. You saved Bongo. I never understood that till now.
Grampa Simpson: (SOBS) All these years I thought you loved that dog more than me.
Homer Simpson: (EMOTIONAL) Why would you think that, just because I put you in a home where they feed you dog food?
Grampa Simpson: Aw, give me a hug, son.
Homer Simpson: Okay, but I'm a little out of practice.

C. Montgomery Burns: Fiscal cliff.
C. Montgomery Burns: Think of the economy as a car and the rich man as the driver. If you don't give the driver all the money, he'll drive you over a cliff. It's just common sense. Furthermore, rich people feel things more deeply than the common man.

Homer Simpson: So, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?
Bart Simpson: Guys who call themselves "preacher" or "deacon" are very bad. Water is money unless gasoline is money. And even though lots of things are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves.

Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) This is the easiest money I've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!
Homer Simpson: (DISGUISING VOICE) It's not that kind!

Bart Simpson: Principal Skinner, could you help me sharpen this pencil?
Seymour Skinner: Well, I guess a little circular grinding might relax me.
Bart Simpson: I can't do this. I'm not ready.
Seymour Skinner: You really didn't study?
Bart Simpson: Well, I slept on my books, so I might have gotten something through osmosis.
Seymour Skinner: So you know what osmosis is!
Bart Simpson: Uh... pajamas?
Seymour Skinner: Let me make this crystal clear to you, Simpson, if you don't pass this test, it will destroy the school.
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLES)
Seymour Skinner: Our entire school riding on that coffee can head of yours. We've got to get you more time to study. But how?
Bart Simpson: Pull the fire alarm. I'd do it, but everyone's lookin' at me.
Seymour Skinner: What to do? What to do?
Angel Skinner: Don't do it, Seymour. You've never broken school rules. Ever.
Mrs. Skinner Devil: You wimp!
Seymour Skinner: Children, remain calm... find your disaster buddy... which is different from your lab partner, but may be the same as your lunchroom buddy.
Bart Simpson: Well, well, well.
Bart Simpson: Looks like Mr. Vanilla just grew some chocolate chips.
Seymour Skinner: Save your analogies for the analogy portion of the exam.
Seymour Skinner: (CONSPIRATORIAL) I bought you time, boy. Don't blow it.

Chief Wiggum: That's right, Kent. The entire force is on the lookout for anyone with an excessive amount of change.
Chief Wiggum: Our top criminologists have a theory as to what the suspect just might look like.
Chief Wiggum: But of course that question mark could be an exclamation point or an Interrobang. And the man... or woman... could be Hispanic...
Chief Wiggum: Or, most frightening, contain no punctuation at all.

Bart Simpson: No, no!
Popeyes: (BITTER GRUMBLING NOISES)

Lisa Simpson: Look, the thing is, it's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what's on it. So, do the ones you know first. If you don't know one, guess B and move on. Now, what is the capital of Massachusetts?

Marge Simpson: What, 'cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top?
Lenny Leonard: Not just any tape, duct tape.
Marge Simpson: All right, but I'm coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid.
Lenny Leonard: Don't worry, Marge. We bought a ton of safety gear from a highly-respected storm-chaser's widow. (OFF HER LOOK) It's not what you're thinking. He died of a heart attack.

Homer Simpson: Maybe the last words I'll ever write.
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aw.
Homer Simpson: Maybe! Look, you guys obviously know about weather, but I understand something much more predictable: women.
Homer Simpson: What women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.

Mav: Honestly, we fell in love with 'em and it seemed like you guys didn't really want 'em.
Homer Simpson: Sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?
Mav: We totally have.
Portia: Like clockwork.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm glad someone has.
Marge Simpson: Look, before anyone says anything else, how could you possibly think you could get our kids?
Portia: It happens more than you know, Marge. I'm a lawyer, he's a surfer, that combination's pretty unstoppable.
Bart Simpson: Well I'm afraid that we don't want to be with anyone but Mom and whoever she chooses to be with.
Lisa Simpson: Portia, you're the woman I dream of becoming, but Mom is my Mom.
Portia: Fine. But you're leaving a gap in our lives that can only be filled by foreign travel, sleeping late and gourmet food.
Mav: You guys lock up. We're goin' to Bali.
Portia: Again?
Homer Simpson: We've won. (FLATLY) Woo hoo.

Marge Simpson: Kids, your father and I have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians.
Homer Simpson: Instead of concentrating on dying, we're going to concentrate on living.
Bart Simpson: If you call this living.
Homer Simpson: (FURIOUS) Why you little...
Homer Simpson: I do call this living! Living the way kids in India can only dream of!
Lisa Simpson: There is nothing like your biological family.
Carl Carlson: (HOLD THE NOTE)

Marge Simpson: (INSTRUCTIONS/BACKSEAT DRIVING COMMENTS) (GPS) Turn right onto First Street, head east. (MARGE) Homer, watch the road! Not this road, the other road!
Homer Simpson: Ladies, please! You can boss me around, just one at a time!
Marge Simpson: On Main Street, turn right now... / Our Sunday drive is ruined! Hands at ten and two!

Homer Simpson: What the?
Gps: Switching to male voice...
Homer Simpson: Finally! A supervisor!
Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED MURMUR)
Jimbo Jones: Hey, Simpson! I dare you to stick this caterpillar down that girl's dress.
(PLAYGROUND: Ext. playground - day)
Bart Simpson: Can't I just stick it in Skinner's Sloppy Joe?
Seymour Skinner: (PASSING BY) It would actually be the only meat in said Joe.
DOLPH: Not everything can be solved with Skinner pranks, Bart.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Yeah, think outside the Skinner box.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (LAUGH)
DOLPH: Hey look, that movie we were in got short-listed for an Oscar.
Mary: (TURNS AROUND TO BART) Who's that stickin' a fuzzy-wuzzy down my back?
Bart Simpson: Mary Spuckler!
Bart Simpson: I thought you left home to be a star.
Mary: There's a lot of thirteen-year-olds out there with a voice and a dream. Only got work as a hand model.
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) That's your hand?
Mary: (SADLY) Just the thumb. Did you miss me?
Bart Simpson: (LOUD) Get out of my face, cootie breath! (QUIET) I did miss you. (LOUD) You stink! (QUIET) Come over Saturday. I'm gonna have to push you in the mud now.
Mary: (LOUD) Don't you pig-waller me, Mister! (QUIET) Do what you must, darlin'.
Jimbo Jones: That sure makes up for my Dad beatin' me last night!
Kearney Zzyzwicz: And for my dyslexia!
(Simpson Front Door: EXT. SIMPSON FRONT DOOR - SATURDAY MORNING)
Bart Simpson: (YAWNS) Mary?
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Thank God I wore the underwear with the hole on the side.
Bart Simpson: It's eight in the morning!

Mary: Rain is so romantic, don't you think?

Mary: Well, tell your eye-ears to watch-listen to this!
Mary: Bart, when are we gonna do girl things, like catch a frog or leg wrestle?
Bart Simpson: Soon, baby, soon. Let me just kill Milhouse's character. He thinks we're on the same team.
Milhouse Van Houten: Betrayed again!
Lisa Simpson: Mary, could I steal Bart for a minute?
Mary: (BITTER) Ask his girlfriend, the game.
Bart Simpson: Oh Mary, you know you're the coolest person I've ever hung out with.
Milhouse Van Houten: Another betrayal!
Lisa Simpson: (FRIENDLY BUT EMPHATIC) Bart Simpson, I don't know what the future holds for you...
Homer Simpson: If you're lucky, me, then this.
Lisa Simpson: ...but, Bart, I do know this: you will not do better than Mary Spuckler, so don't ignore her for a stupid video game!
Bart Simpson: Hey, relax. She knows she's the apple of the corner of my eye.
Mary: Bart, do you mind if I call my mother?
Bart Simpson: Not at all.
Mary: (EXTREMELY LOUD) Mama! Come pick me up, I'm bored!

Brandine Del Roy: (EEFING NOISES, BUT LESS ENERGY)
Bart Simpson: A lot of musical talent in this house. But no one blows on a blade of grass like you.
Mary: Eight more payments and I own this. But are you sure there ain't no video game you'd rather be playin'?
Bart Simpson: All eyes on you, baby.
Mary: (SINGS) I USED TO THINK I WANTED TO ROAM...BUT THERE AIN'T NOT NEVER NO PLACE NONE BETTER THAN HOME / (SPOKEN) Count the negatives, it all works out.
Mary: (SINGS) THEY SAY THAT HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS...BUT FOR ME IT'S WHERE THE BART IS... (SPOKEN) Now what are you doing?!
Mary: (HURT) I wrote a whole song for you, Bart Simpson! Least you could do is pay me full mind. I was gonna enter it in a competition.
Bart Simpson: Ay carumba!
Bart Simpson: (SUPPORTIVE) Well you're gonna win, 'cause you've got star quality. Like the Hulk in movies other than "The Hulk."
Mary: (VERY MOVED) You know what? Every now and then you say the perfect thing.
Witney Spuckler: Mary, it's our turn to use the boyfriend room!
Mary: Y'all don't have boyfriends!
Jitney Spuckler: We's gonna practice kissing with this French-Canadian mountain man.
French-canadian Mountain Man: Pourquoi m'avez-vous amené ici?
Mary: He's still wearing leg shackles.
Jitney Spuckler: All men is unpolished stones.
French-canadian Mountain Man: Où est le whiskey que vous m'avez promis?
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - Bart's room - later that night)
Bart Simpson: ...and then I ran right home to you.
Milhouse Van Houten: You did everything great, Bart. Then you told me all about it like a true gentleman. I can't wait to use your moves on Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: (ENTERS) Ew! On every level! Ew! Bart, you have to treat girls like they matter -- not like they're a bunch of Milhice. (OFF THEIR LOOK) What? It's the plural of Milhouse. Look it up.
Homer Simpson: Listen to your sister, boy.
Lisa Simpson: What I'm saying applies to you too, Dad.
Homer Simpson: What are you talkin' about? Marge and I are goin' great.
Marge Simpson: (ANGRY) Homer Simpson! Did you take Maggie to Moe's?
Homer Simpson: It was during Happy Hour. Don't you want our baby to be happy?
Lisa Simpson: Don't you see, you're taking women for granted. And aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate.
Homer Simpson: (SCOFFS) How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.
Bart Simpson: More like balder and wider.
Homer Simpson: (MAD) Why you little... I'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!

HILLBILLY M.C.: Thank you, last contestant. Tomorrow we will feature the no-longer racist country comedy of Barry the Satellite TV Guy.
Barry the Satellite TV Guy: Isn't it funny how all people are of equal worth? Please do not boycott my line of power tools.
HILLBILLY M.C.: Now all Barry's jokes are about his ex-wife.
Barry the Satellite TV Guy: No they ain't. We're back together.
HILLBILLY M.C.: Then you got no act. (CHUCKLES) And now, the winner is:
HILLBILLY M.C.: Devon Peacock!
Devon Peacock: I can finally get my suspender buckled!
Cletus Spuckler: (GRIM) Looks like we got a feud with the Peacocks now.
Cletus Spuckler: Uh-huh.
Mary: All I care is what you think, Bart.
Lisa Simpson: (WHISPERS) Compliment her!
Bart Simpson: (CONFUSED, TO SELF) I don't know what she wants. What would my heroes say?
SUPERHERO WITH CLAWS: (GRIM) Slash her face now, Bart. Slash it while she least expects it.
Max Weinberg: Bart, tell Mary to play the drums -- the only thing anyone listens to in any band.
Bart Simpson: (TO SELF) It's hard to pick just one of those.
Max Weinberg: Bart, you'd better get your act together. And me too. I've gotta get these shirts to the drycleaners.
Max Weinberg: They close at six!!!
Mary: Bart Simpson, you get out of that gosh-darned fugue state this instant! Lift my spirits!
Bart Simpson: Um... lifting people's spirits is an interesting topic. For centuries, Neanderthal and astronaut alike have enjoyed lifting spirits.
Mary: (VERY DISAPPOINTED) You're givin' me book report talk?
Brazilian Man: Excuse me, I am a Brazilian record producer. I concentrate in the rapidly-growing jug band-samba fusion market.
Mary: Oh my God! Do you know Billy-Bobaloo Skeeter-Rodriguez?
Brazilian Man: Know him? (UPBEAT) Before he was famous he kidnapped my mother! Mary, would you like to have dinner with me and my handsome, girl-crazy son tonight? (INDICATES SON)
Brazilian 12-year-old Boy: (BRAZILIAN ACCENT) I am the first boy to get my own liquor ad.
Mary: Bart? You wanna come with us? I need you.
Bart Simpson: Mary, we've just been through three hours of music. Usually, I only have music one hour a week, and the teacher spends it reading real estate listings for Fire Island.
Mary: (DEAD SERIOUS) I'll see you later, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Mary? Are you okay?
Mary: (FLATLY) Sure. Everything's fine.
Elderly Woman: Everything's fine...

Bart Simpson: Melvis? Where's Mary?
Melvis: I brung you regrets from my sister. She has been de-avoidably untained.
Bart Simpson: (WORRIED NOISE) Am I getting dumped?
Caricature: (WOODY ALLEN VOICE) Okay Bart, maybe you blew it by taking Mary for granted. Women are life's great mystery, along with why do they give you salt and pepper at a Chinese restaurant. But if you want one more shot, I know a date that'll turn this mighty Aphrodite into your purple rose of Cairo. (OFF BART'S LOOK) Those are movies I made -- my oeuvre. Sounds dirty, but it's not.

Kirk Van Houten: Okay Luann, it's all settled. We'll ditch Milhouse!
Mary: (THOUGHTFUL) Bart, I think it's best if we "take a break."
Bart Simpson: Good idea. I can chuck eggs at the other couples.
Mary: (CHOKED-UP) Just hug me, dummy.
Bart Simpson: Back pats?! (APPALLED) This is a break up!
Mary: You'll be fine: there's a pot for every possum.
(Apartment Building: Int. APARTMENT BUILDING - small and lonely room - day)
Bart Simpson: Give me another chance. I'll be way more attentive to your needs on the seesaw -- I'll stay down there for as long as you want.
Mary: Sorry, Bart, I'm a hillbilly girl of thirteen. If I'm not married in the next few months, nobody's gonna want me. Not even Ol' Joe Clabby.
Ol' Joe Clabby: (WALTER BRENNAN VOICE) Hey, you're a pretty li'l thing, you are. But, tick-tock, tick-tock.

Marge Simpson: I was the only one without a date at Patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!
Homer Simpson: You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go!
Marge Simpson: You should know that me saying I don't care means I couldn't care more.
Homer Simpson: I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
Marge Simpson: Bart, would you go to your room while your father and I finish our little talk?
Bart Simpson: (UPSET) Little talk? You guys are having a big fight! This is the problem with women! They don't say what they mean, until it's too late!
Marge Simpson: All right. Fine. If you boys want it, I'll tell you what I really think.
Homer Simpson: Finally, we're gettin' somewhere.
Marge Simpson: You're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause I still like the dog.
Homer Simpson: (SAD SIGH) Hand me my suitcase, boy.
Bart Simpson: When do I get a Krusty suitcase?
Homer Simpson: When you're older.
(Apartment Building: ext. apartment BUILDING - day)
(Building: Int. building - front desk - continuous)
Bart Simpson: So this is where you go when Mom kicks you out?
Homer Simpson: You're saying it like it happens all the time. And by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. You call this a Platinum Club experience?
Front Desk Man: We'll get right on it, Mr. Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (PEEVED) I've told you a thousand times, call me Homer!
Bart Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE) What's this notice on the wall?
Homer Simpson: Standard hotel boilerplate. It just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.
Bart Simpson: Aw, man! We just missed it.
Homer Simpson: Oh, it'll happen again, son.
Bart Simpson: Um, I've gotta make a phone call.
Homer Simpson: Knock yourself out.

(Brokewood Apartments: Int. Brokewood apartments - bathroom - moments later)
Bart Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Mary? That's odd, I thought I was calling the Suicide Not Line. Because I'm doin' great. So, um, how are you handling "taking a break?"
Mary: (SUPER UPBEAT) Great! It turns out Adele was right: ain't nothin' better for songwritin' than when your relationship takes a bolt to the brain. Tell me what you think:
Mary: (SINGING) I BROKE UP WITH A FELLA BUT I AIN'T GRIEVIN' / HE WAS MUCH TOO PROUD OF UNDERACHIEVIN'
Mary: I CAN'T BELIEVE I LIKED HIM, I MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND
Mary: HE WASN'T SO SMART OR HANDSOME OR KIND...EVERY MOMENT WITH THAT BOY WAS TOTALLY HORRID / AND I CAN'T EVEN TELL WHERE HIS HAIR MEETS HIS FOREHEAD.
Bart Simpson: Why did I buy her that rhyming dictionary?
Mary: (SINGING) MY EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, NOW I SEE HIS WARTS / I WISH HIM WELL, DOWN IN HELL, WHERE HE'LL EAT HIS OWN SHORTS! (THEN SWEET AND SINCERE) It just poured out of me, like venom from a snake!
Homer Simpson: I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.

Kicked-out Husband #1: It's so great here -- no wife to get mad at you for closing your laptop whenever they walk into the room.
Kicked-out Husband #2: (A LITTLE TOO EAGER) Or getting her kid hooked on pot. She's my kid too, you know.
Homer Simpson: You know what we need? A classic "kicked outta the house" party. Now who's got a rockin' CD?
Kicked-out Husband #1: I've got the audio book of Robert Caro's "The Passage of Power."
Homer Simpson: That's it? Well, then let's "power" this party up!
Bart Simpson: SPUCKLER MARY, PLEASE FORGIVE ME / ALL I ASK IS ONE MORE CHANCE...
Robert A. Caro: "AIR FORCE ONE, the President's plane, is divided, behind the crew's cockpit, into three compartments. In the first of them, just behind the cockpit, women sat weeping and Secret Service agents were trying to hold back tears ("You've heard of strong men crying; well, we had it there that day," recalls a reporter)...
Bart Simpson: I miss Mary.
Kicked-out Husband #2: I miss Roxie. That's the club where I used to smoke pot with my kid.
Homer Simpson: This calls for decisive action -- like L.B.J.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the Civil Rights Act.
Kicked-out Husband #1: But how do we figure out what to do?
Homer Simpson: The same way Hollywood does, by watching British movies!
(COMMON ROOM: int. common room - later)

ALAN RICKMAN: Love is more powerful than all my magic.
Bart Simpson: Hard to believe that country used to rule anything.

(TV ROOM: Int. TV room - continuous)

Homer Simpson: Finally, a kids' show that isn't trying to sell you something. Which reminds me, we need to order more rectangles.
Sensitive Female Voice: (INSTRUCTING A CHILD) Friends?
Sensitive Female Voice: (INSTRUCTING A CHILD) Friends.
Sensitive Female Voice: (INSTRUCTING A CHILD) Colleagues.
Marge Simpson: (HUGE GASP) Don't watch that DVD!
Marge Simpson: (POINTS TO TV) I threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good!
Marge Simpson: Look at me!
Lisa Simpson: Bart? You wanted to show me something?
Adult Lisa: But surely you didn't give up on love after just one setback. Love is our only defense against the abyss in this meaningless universe.
Marge Simpson: Maybe instead of watching TV with the kids, you could take them outside and... what are you doing?
Marge Simpson: (UNHAPPY) This so-called educational DVD may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it!
Lisa Simpson: Wait a minute. Didn't Bart and I both watch this thing when we were little?
Marge Simpson: (GRIMLY) I'm afraid so.
Lisa Simpson: Well, the obvious question is... why did I turn out so... academically superior... while Bart--
Marge Simpson: (CUTTING HER OFF, QUICKLY) While Bart turned out so wonderful in his own way!
Bart Simpson: That's the way people talk about Ralph! Ralph, whose favorite color is peanut butter!
Marge Simpson: I wish I knew what happened...
Bart Simpson: (BRAIN-DEAD) Aooga... aooga... aooga...
Marge Simpson: And now that I know better, no DVDs for you kids. Just educational television.

Marge Simpson: Okay, no TV at all.
Lisa Simpson: What?!
Homer Simpson: Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets.
Marge Simpson: Fine, no TV for twenty-four hours.
Bart Simpson: Twenty-four hours? Where'd you pull that crazy number?
Marge Simpson: We can do without TV for a day! We're taking Maggie to a children's bookstore, where she can learn the old-fashioned way -- the way children did from nineteen-ten to two thousand and two.
Marge Simpson: Homer, a little help?
Homer Simpson: I'm on it.

Security Guard: Sorry, folks. She doesn't even work here.
Homer Simpson: "Spot the Hidden Objects."
Homer Simpson: (TO BOOK) Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met.

Bart Simpson: Don't worry, I'll clean it up. Get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors.

Kearney Zzyzwicz: Yo, Bart, your grown man friend is all right.
DOLPH: We should start threatening more adults.
Jimbo Jones: Wouldn't that make us criminals instead of bullies?
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Let's beat up a philosopher till he gives us the answer.
Jimbo Jones: (AGREEING NOISES)
(Truck: Int. truck - continuous)
Marge Simpson: (TURNED ON) Mm-hmm!
Milhouse Van Houten: (LOOSENS TIE) I made my Mom happy and got through the bullies without a punch. Being an adult is super easy!
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLES)
Milhouse Van Houten: You dope. It says those are for her pleasure. Now it's time for me to live my fantasy with mature themes.
Milhouse Van Houten: I'll go behind that curtain a boy, but come out a man.
(Election Polling Station: Int. election polling station)
Milhouse Van Houten: (PONDERING, INSIDE BOOTH) Hm... more money for schools? That could translate into more homework.
Seymour Skinner: (ENTERING) I know this is highly illegal, but you're not leaving this booth till you punch "yes."
Gary Chalmers: (ENTERING) Don't bother screaming for help... this is a municipal, off-cycle election.
Seymour Skinner: (OMINOUS) There's no one for miles.
Gary Chalmers: (GRIMLY) Don't forget your sticker.
Seymour Skinner: (LAUGH)
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - day)
Moe Szyslak: Well, in my case my Mom was hit with a voodoo curse, I gestated for five years, then I popped out backwards and on fire.
Bart Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) Really?
Moe Szyslak: (NODS) Keep my tail right here in this jar.
Moe Szyslak: Good times.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - day)
Lisa Simpson: Mom, I think Maggie misses TV.
Lisa Simpson: You know Mom, I was thinking we could take Maggie downtown. "The Jazz Hole" is featuring a Dizzy Gillespie tribute band. (AWESTRUCK) Their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks...
Marge Simpson: I don't think so. The U.S. Embassy has warned people not to go to downtown Springfield.
Lisa Simpson: (SADLY) I get it. Middle child. Never do what I want.
Lisa Simpson: Okay, I also know of a puppet show...
(Lithuanian Center: Ext. Lithuanian center - night)
(Auditorium: Int. Auditorium)
Cute Puppet: (GIRL VOICE WITH SLAVIC ACCENT) Long before the Teutonic slaughters visited upon our people, there was the massacre by Mstislov of Kiev in 1132.
Marge Simpson: Maybe we should go.
Usher: Nobody leave till every puppet dead!
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - outside bart's doorway - afternoon)
Marge Simpson: Now what are you doing?
Bart Simpson: Just one sec: Nelson gave me some notes on a prank I'm doing.
Bart Simpson: Now, I asked you here because I know a cool grownup who will take you to that club in the city.
Lisa Simpson: Really? Who?
Lisa Simpson: Milhouse?
Lisa Simpson: Well, Milhouse, you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club because they're in no position to turn anyone away. But it doesn't matter, 'cause we can't pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway.
Bart Simpson: Au contraire, starfish hair!
Bart Simpson: The Baby Poindexter Company is being forced to pay a settlement to any parent who had enough misguided love to buy their videos.
Lisa Simpson: They're not gonna write a check to a couple of kids.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad.
Homer Simpson: Marge, can I get a subscription to Highlights Magazine?
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's for children!
Homer Simpson: Where does it say that?
Marge Simpson: Read the rest of the title!
Homer Simpson: (READING) "Highlights..." "for..." (BEAT, ANNOYED GRUNT)

Marge Simpson: (VERY TURNED ON NOISE)
Marge Simpson: Can you find anything you like in this bed?
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Just my honey pie.
Homer Simpson: Wanna split it while we snuggle?
Homer Simpson: (CHAGRINED) Licking the wrapper.
(Springfield Bus Station: EXT. springfield bus station - early morning)
Bus Vendor: There you go, one adult and two children, one-way downtown.
Bus Vendor: If you like.
Lisa Simpson: Now remember, I can't sit backwards or I get sick.
Bart Simpson: Well, if I look at your face, I get sick.
Bart Simpson: Make me, baldy.
Milhouse Van Houten: My adulthood!
Bus Station Guy: (HOMELESS MAN VOICE) I never thought I'd say this, but that is conduct unbecoming of a bus station.

P.R. Person: Looks like you're entitled to the full rebate of nineteen ninety-five.
Bart Simpson: That's all you pay for screwing up a child for life?
P.R. Person: Terrific. Just need your signature.
P.R. Person: X is fine.

Milhouse Van Houten: But what if we can't afford not to buy it?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - day)
Homer Simpson: Waldo. Waldo. Waldo.
DUFFMAN VOICE MILHOUSE: I'm feeling a strange, refreshing brew of emotions. Oh yeah!
Marge Simpson: Homer, Bart said the kids were going to the Van Houtens, but Luann just told me they're supposed to be here. They've disappeared!
Homer Simpson: We'll get those kids back.
Homer Simpson: Because we just bought them new shoes!
Homer Simpson: (FLIPPING PAGES) Waldo. Waldo.
(Simpson Driveway: EXT. Simpson driveway - moments later)
Marge Simpson: Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club I wouldn't take her to?
Homer Simpson: How many kids will jazz corrupt?
(MARRIOTT-STYLE HOTEL: INT. MARRIOTt-STYLE HOTEL - conference center)
Saleswoman: ...lap pool and fully-equipped gym with eucalyptus towels. Now, let me give you the fourteen different apartment configurations: The Hacienda, The Urban Oasis, Castle in the Sky, Connecticut Sunset...
Bart Simpson: Lady, my stomach's full and I wanna go. That's how it works in this country.
Saleswoman: If you try to leave, you'll find the doors are locked.
Lisa Simpson: Well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you...
Saleswoman: (FLIRTY) Oh, I hope it's that he's single.
Saleswoman: You're a bit of freak. I like that.
(OTHER ROOM: Int. other room - continuous)
Lisa Simpson: "Kirk?" Don't you have something to tell her?
Saleswoman: Just looking for a casual hookup?
Saleswoman: (TURNED ON) Ooh. I love how I don't exactly understand what you're saying.
(Downtown Springfield: Ext. downtown springfield - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Homie, do you see anything?
Homer Simpson: No. I'm sorry. It's... wait a minute.
Professor Jonathan Frink: (PLEADING HIS CASE) When I said you needed a software update, it was not a criticism.
Homer Simpson: (SERIOUS) We've found what we're looking for.
Marge Simpson: The kids?
Homer Simpson: Sure, they could be here. Who knows?
(LOCKED ROOM: INT. locked ROOM - CONTINUOUS)
Saleswoman: I love how your arms are too short and thin for your legs. Just like a crocodile.
Milhouse Van Houten: (PULLS TIE LOOSE) How did you know it was me?
Marge Simpson: The top of your head has a five o'clock shadow.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Your hair is growing back! Tell me your secret!
Marge Simpson: He's ten years old!

Kirk Van Houten: (ADMONISHING) ...And worst of all you cast my vote! Who did you vote for in the non-partisan judicial election?
Milhouse Van Houten: Williamson.
Kirk Van Houten: No, no, no!
Milhouse Van Houten: (TO KIRK) I'm really sorry, Dad. But I have to say it was pretty cool having your life.
Kirk Van Houten: You mean that?
Milhouse Van Houten: I'd be happy to wind up just like you.
Kirk Van Houten: (TOUCHED, DESPITE HIMSELF) I hope you remember that when I can't pay for your college.
Kirk Van Houten: Now how would you like to go to your own parent-teacher interview while I see a movie?
Milhouse Van Houten: I'd like that.
Homer Simpson: Son, promise you will never look like me.
Bart Simpson: I sure hope not.
Homer Simpson: Why you little! That's not a heartwarming thing to end on!
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING)
Homer Simpson: I can't believe you're reading when there's so much great stuff on TV.
Lisa Simpson: Hmm, you're right. It is the golden age of well-written, brilliantly-acted TV shows.
Homer Simpson: (SCOFFS) Writing is for bathroom walls, and acting is for getting out of DUI's. The only reason TV exists is for reality shows about white-trash scuzzbags doing sub-human, made-up jobs.
Homer Simpson: Ooo! Jail music!
Macho Narrator: When storage lockers are abandoned, we open 'em up!
Macho Narrator: Our expert bidders face off in the ultimate contest to discover the amazing treasures within!
Macho Narrator: This is... "Storage Battles."
Homer Simpson: (CONSIDERING) I'll give it one marathon.
CJ Ramone: I don't care what people say -- I am feeling this unit!

CJ Ramone: Eh, just some nobody.
CJ Ramone: Here we go! Here we go! Bub-ble wrap!
CJ Ramone: (SMUG) If there's wrap, it ain't crap!
CJ Ramone: Bingo! Antique bayonets! I'm talking World War One, Spanish American War... Crimea, baby!
(MILITARY ANTIQUE SHOP: int. military antique shop - later)
Dealer: (CONSIDERING NOISE) If you found the right buyer, on the right day, and he knew nothing about bayonets, you might sell it for, possibly... five hundred dollars?
CJ Ramone: (TO CAMERA) Definitely five hundred dollars! Five hundred! Five hundy!
CJ Ramone: Five hundamaninos!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bathroom - continuous)
Marge Simpson: (PLEASED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: High-five me, Marge!

Homer Simpson: (GASP) There's other P.O.s? (WORRIED) Uh-oh, better put on my game shades.

Homer Simpson: (COCKY) In the money game, cash is king.
(STORAGE LOCKER COMPLEX: EXT. storage locker complex - LATER - ESTABLISHING)
Marge Simpson: We spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes?
Homer Simpson: You won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.
Marge Simpson: I wasn't laughing -- I was being worried.
Homer Simpson: Feather boas?
Bart Simpson: (RE: BOX) Mine's full of hand mirrors.
Lisa Simpson: I've got perfume spritzers.
Marge Simpson: Makeup and baby oil!
Homer Simpson: Tights? Robes? (MOANS) This stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.
Lisa Simpson: "Property of Abraham J. Simpson?" This is Grampa's stuff!
Homer Simpson: Why would my man-dad have lady stuff?
Marge Simpson: (SOTTO) It's not all lady stuff. Look at all these fitness publications.
Homer Simpson: Beefcake mags?
Marge Simpson: I think your dad might be gay.
Homer Simpson: (FRUSTRATED NOISE) That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. (REALIZING, MOANS) My gay dad is gay for gays.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - night - establishing)
Marge Simpson: I think this is great! Old gay men are adorable! Like wrinkle dogs in a wrinkle dog calendar.
Homer Simpson: (MOPEY) Those are pretty cute...
Marge Simpson: Your dad's been in the closet for so long, he probably doesn't know how tolerant society's become. They even had a gay float in the Pride Parade last year.
Homer Simpson: My dad's always been so angry. Maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy.
Marge Simpson: (TURNED ON) Oh Homie, you're so... enlightened.
Homer Simpson: (SEDUCTIVE) Yeah. Gay rights are human rights, baby.
(Springfield Retirement Castle: Ext. retirement castle - day)
Bart Simpson: (TO MARGE) You sure you're not just doing all this because it's cool to be accepting of a gay family member?
Marge Simpson: Oh honey, that's just silly! (TO HERSELF) This'll show Helen Lovejoy, always bragging about her He-She cousin!
Marge Simpson: Abe... we found your storage locker.
Homer Simpson: It's okay, Dad. We know the truth, and we love you.
Grampa Simpson: What?! The contents of that locker are my private business! Get out!
(Hallway: int. hallway - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Just admit who you are, and you can find new love.
Marge Simpson: If you don't want to die alone, come out of your room!
Oldsters: (MOANING) Love... love... love...
Oldsters: (MOANING) Love... love...

Helen Lovejoy: (SMUG) Hi Marge. I was just taking Stanlerina to get her hormone shots.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)
Marge Simpson: Your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you. We've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late!
Lisa Simpson: Why don't you put a personal ad on the internet? That's how young people date these days.
Bart Simpson: (TO LISA) It's weird that you don't consider yourself a young person.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) I know. It's weird to me too.
Marge Simpson: "Help me out of the closet! Wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death."
Homer Simpson: (CHIMING IN) No fatties!
Marge Simpson: How about some fatties?
Homer Simpson: (POUTING) Fine.
Marge Simpson: Okay, post this under "Men Seeking Men," but what sub-heading... nothing too serious... here we go -- "Casual Encounters!" Perfect, no pressure!
(Park: EXT. park - duck pond - day)
Marge Simpson: (EXCITED) I hope someone saw our ad.
Homer Simpson: If I can't find my father a man to kiss and cuddle, then I've failed as a son.
Marge Simpson: (GASP) Someone's coming!
Waylon Smithers: Are you "Wrinkled and Romantic?"
Grampa Simpson: Huh? What the heck are you talking about, Spectacles?
Bart Simpson: Grampa, you were the original bad boy!
Waylon Smithers: Oh, I've been hung up on someone for years, but I'm trapped in "the friend zone." (SIGHS) It's time for me to move on.
Grampa Simpson: So move on! You're blocking the ducks!
Marge Simpson: Don't you want to be happy, Abe? Admit who you are, a wonderful gay man!
Grampa Simpson: (SPLUTTERS) What?! I don't ride side-saddle! I'm straight as a submarine!
Homer Simpson: Then how do you explain this?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hello Smithers! Fancy seeing you in Casual Encounter Park.
C. Montgomery Burns: (GASPS) You're Glamorous Godfrey!
Homer Simpson: Who?

Homer Simpson: Look at all this wrestling stuff.
Bart Simpson: Ay carumba!
Grampa Simpson: (ADMITTING) Fine. I was Glamorous Godfrey.
Marge Simpson: (SOBS A LITTLE)
Homer Simpson: What's wrong?
Marge Simpson: I so wanted him to be gay.
Grampa Simpson: (SHRUGS) On V.E. Day, I kissed a man by mistake.
Marge Simpson: (SMALL) Thank you.
(Burns Manor: ext. BURNS MANSION - ESTABLISHING - DAY)
Homer Simpson: You were a world-famous wrestler? Spill the beans, old man. Word beans!
Grampa Simpson: (SIGHS) All right, I'll tell ya... It was the 1950s...
Homer Simpson: (GROANS) Those things?
(WRESTLING ARENA: int. wrestling arena - DAY)
Grampa Simpson: It was the heyday of pro wrestling. You could make good money if you were the manly mixture of strong and fat we called beefy.
Grampa Simpson: Good guys were called "baby faces"...and bad guys were called "heels."
Grampa Simpson: I was the king of the heels, Glamorous Godfrey.
Angry Crowd: How dare he! / That was drinking milk!
Grampa Simpson: My motto was "Always Cheat."
Grampa Simpson: But the thing that really drove them crazy was my vanity.
Glamorous Godfrey: You are the luckiest people in the world. You get to look at me.
Crowd: (BOOS)
Grampa Simpson: Yeah, I was boastful before all your football show-boaters, rap music-ers, and TV beach Italians. But there was a downside to being hated... being hated.
(THE PAST: INT. THE PAST - VARIOUS - flashback)
(Storage Facility: int. storage facility - day)
Grampa Simpson: I just couldn't take it.
Grampa Simpson: (SIGHS) Being despised was no way to live.
C. Montgomery Burns: Pshaw!
C. Montgomery Burns: Pshaw, I say!
Grampa Simpson: Pshaw yourself!
Marge Simpson: Homer, do something! They're killing each other!
Grampa Simpson: (TO BURNS) Oh yeah-- (MUFFLED NOISES)
C. Montgomery Burns: The world may have despised Glamorous Godfrey, but that conceited mother-puncher was my hero.
C. Montgomery Burns: Please, Abe, let me buy you dinner in exchange for a few tales of the golden age of professional grappling.
Grampa Simpson: Sorry, I been trying to forget those days for fifty years.
Bart Simpson: But Grampa...
Bart Simpson: I wanna hear about old-time wrestling too.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, it looks like you've made a new fan. It'd be a shame to let him down...
Grampa Simpson: Oh, fine. One dinner.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. So we'll take the boy and make a night of it.
Homer Simpson: I don't know. Should I really let the men who ruined my (RE: GRAMPA) past and (RE: BURNS) present hang out with the kid who's going to ruin my future?
Bart Simpson: I'll bring you home my dessert.
Homer Simpson: (IMMEDIATELY SOLD) Text me the choices.
(OLD-TIME CLUB: ext. old-time CLUB - night)
C. Montgomery Burns: I can't believe I'm on the town with Glamorous Godfrey himself! Tell me of your epic battle with Swedish Olaf Johannsen.
Grampa Simpson: Oh yeah, "The Fury of the Fjords"...
Swedish Wrestler: (COMPLAINING NOISES)
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHS) You settled that Swede's meatballs!
C. Montgomery Burns: What I wouldn't give to see Glamorous Godfrey in action once more!
C. Montgomery Burns: Would you ever consider throwing your wig back into the ring?
Grampa Simpson: Go back to being a villain? Forget that! Being hated is the worst feeling there is.
C. Montgomery Burns: You've got it all wrong, my friend. Once you see it my way, you'll understand that being hated is the greatest feeling in the world.
C. Montgomery Burns: DON'T REALLY CARE FOR CHASING WOMEN /
C. Montgomery Burns: NO, I GET DRUNK ON... BOOS /
C. Montgomery Burns: BECAUSE...

Oldsters: (EXCITED HUBBUB)
Bart Simpson: I can't wait to see Grampa kick some ass! He's always pretended to be boring, but he's really a straight-up psycho!
Marge Simpson: Your grandfather is not psycho! The only thing he's "straight-up" is loves you.
Lisa Simpson: "Gorilla Joe," "Gorilla Sam," "Gorilla Pete," "Ook and Eek, the Gorilla Twins"... Where did Mr. Burns dig up all these old wrestlers?
Homer Simpson: Apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things. Just like you and me. Swear to God.
C. Montgomery Burns: Welcome, aficionados of the roped ring, to a thrilling night of senior-on-senior action.
Elderly Audience: (OLD PERSON CHEERS)

Crowd: (ENRAGED BOOS)
Bart Simpson: You show 'em, Godfrey! You're the prettiest old man in the world!
Lisa Simpson: Why do you think bad guys are so cool?
Bart Simpson: Why do you still have a thing for Nelson?
Lisa Simpson: Do not. That's ridiculous-- It's just-- It's that-- He's-- (BLURTING) He's a rebel and only I can change him!
Crowd: (ENRAGED BOOS)
Marge Simpson: It's so sad that Grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his God-given wrestling skills. What kind of person revels in disapproval?!
Bart Simpson: (SCHEMING) What kind of person, indeed?
(Little League Field: ext. little league field - day)
Milhouse Van Houten: It's the prettiest boy in Springfield... Bart Simpson!

Sideshow Mel: I've never seen anyone so full of self-regard! And I've worked with Bob Balaban!
Crowd: (BOOS)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - later that day)
Marge Simpson: Your behavior at that game was unacceptable! You're lucky they gave you your participant trophy.
Lisa Simpson: I got one for just watching the game.
Bart Simpson: Listen, getting people riled up is what heels do!
Homer Simpson: Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!
Homer Simpson: No I don't. If you pray to Superman.
Bart Simpson: Well sure I am. I always thought Grampa was lame, but he's really awesome!
Homer Simpson: Your grandfather is super lame! I mean, if he wasn't a terrible father, what's my excuse for this?
Marge Simpson: I know your Grampa seems exciting now... But all that preening and cheating, those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: ext. nuclear plant - day - establishing)
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONTENTED SIGHS)
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONTENTED SIGHS)
Grampa Simpson: Burnsy, I can't remember the last time I was so happy.
Homer Simpson: You grandson-ruining fiend! Look what your "number one fan" did at show and tell!
C. Montgomery Burns: Who would film such a thing?
Homer Simpson: It's found footage!
Grampa Simpson: So what! We could use another winner in this family.
Homer Simpson: How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!
C. Montgomery Burns: Fake? Ridiculous! If professional wrestling were fake... that would make every fan in the history of the sport a complete and utter moron.
C.H.U.M.: (ROBOT WHIMPERING) Mercy!
C. Montgomery Burns: You know, I've always had a keen eye for tiny talent.
C. Montgomery Burns: Perhaps you and the lad could "tag team" up...
Grampa Simpson: Wrestle with Bart? (CONSIDERS) He ain't beefy, but he is infuriating and you can't teach infuriating. Monty, you're a genius!
Homer Simpson: Bart cannot be an old-time wrestler! As your inattentive son, and your incompetent employee, I forbid it!
(OLD-TIME WRESTLING PAVILION: ext. old-time wrestling PAVILION - day)

Grampa Simpson: So, Beautiful, you got your moves memorized?
Bart Simpson: You know it, Glamorous. (ACTS OUT MOVES) Eye gouge, ear bite, folding chair, hair pull, face-fart, flying face-fart, and then I start fighting dirty.
Grampa Simpson: (PROUD CHUCKLE) They're gonna hate you so much.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, I get it. You're here to tell the kid he can't wrestle with his Grampa.
Marge Simpson: I don't care if Bart is a wrestler, a busboy, or even a stoplight squeegee man... as long as he's a nice person.
Marge Simpson: But if he gets too much attention for acting bad, he might turn bad on the inside...
Grampa Simpson: (DEFIANT) Eh, that's women-talk. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to comb out my curls.
Grampa Simpson: (AS HE COMBS) One, two, three...
(WRESTLING ARENA: int. wrestling arena - hallway - LATER)
Nerdy Fat Kid: Beautiful Bart, can I have your autograph?

Grampa Simpson: I ain't a heel no more -- I'm a good guy... and you're a baby-face.
Bart Simpson: (UPSET) But, but, what about the cheating?
Grampa Simpson: No more cheating.
Bart Simpson: And the preening?
Grampa Simpson: No more preening.
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) But I'm so pretty.
Grampa Simpson: That's for others to say now.
C. Montgomery Burns: What are you doing, Godfrey! You're a villain, not some bullet-brained rail-splitter. Without someone to hate, there's no excitement, no thrill!
Grampa Simpson: I don't care! My grandson's soul is at stake!
C. Montgomery Burns: How dare you! I wrote a song for you! When am I ever going to use that again? Curse you and this morbidly obese little half-wit.

Marge Simpson: (CONCERNED MURMUR) Did you tell the teacher?

Gary Chalmers: Mrs. Simpson, this school does not hire bullies...
Seymour Skinner: That's right. We...
Gary Chalmers: Quiet, nerd.
Marge Simpson: Well, she's just a substitute. Maybe you could transfer Ms. Cantwell to another school.
Gary Chalmers: Nix! She's already got two weeks tenure so she's impossible to dislodge.
Homer Simpson: I hate unions. There's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's you.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah. (CHANTING) I say "union" you say "power"! Union...
Marge Simpson: (WEAKLY) Power.

Ned Flanders: Homer, just call me a little bubble 'cause I'm on the level. (INSISTENT) Punch me.

Ned Flanders: C'mon, Homer. I'm insisting on a fisting.
Waylon Smithers: What's this about a fisting?
Homer Simpson: I'm not punching you, Flanders.
Ned Flanders: What? Why?!
Homer Simpson: Because if I hit you back, we'll be even. But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man. And I'm liking the way that feels.
Ned Flanders: No! You can't! If I'm not as good as you... then I'm horrible!
Homer Simpson: It's not for me to judge, Ned because... (REALIZING) I am the better man!

Lisa Simpson: That's right! Bart must not be judged by these kids, but by a jury, of kids. Mostly these kids. There's only so many kids.

Ralph Wiggum: I can go koo-koo and no one can stop me!
Janet Reno: That's exactly what George W. Bush said when he was inaugurated. People don't remember that.
Bart Simpson: (CONFIDENT) This case is goin' great. Although as usual, I look nothing like the courtroom artist's drawing.
Bart Simpson: Nice try, pop.
(Springfield: Ext. springfield - aerial shot - night)
Waylon Smithers: Very dramatic, sir. A little more brooding, and...
Waylon Smithers: There's my superhero! Now let's get you to bed and...
C. Montgomery Burns: Hist! Look there!
C. Montgomery Burns: This looks like a job for Fruit-Bat-Man! (EXTENDED HIGH-PITCHED BAT SQUEAK)
Waylon Smithers: Perhaps we should just call the police.
C. Montgomery Burns: The police? Bah! Every last man on the take. And I should know, because I'm on the give.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DOPPLER) I've never felt more alive!
(Kwik-E-Mart: int. Kwik-E-Mart - a little later)
Waylon Smithers: Look. I'll give you each a thousand dollars if you pretend to let that old man out there stop this crime.
C. Montgomery Burns: Feel the crumbling fist of justice!
Snake Jailbird: Ouchers! (COLLAPSING) Oh dear.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (STAGEY) Who are you, mysterious octogenarian of the night?
C. Montgomery Burns: (MASK ON) I am the squeak in the rafters, the flutter in the chimney, the tiny teeth-marks in the peach... I am "Fruit-Bat-Man!" Now, back to my natural realm, the inky night!
C. Montgomery Burns: I'll just take one of these keychain penlights.
C. Montgomery Burns: You have to keep squeezing this thing?! Who has the strength for that?
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - gym - continuous)
Lunchlady Dora: So when I came in the Monday after Easter, I noticed three dozen eggs missing.
Lisa Simpson: And do you think this boy took those eggs?
Lunchlady Dora: Him?! All he takes are sodas and desserts!
Marge Simpson: Objection! Unhealthy!
Lisa Simpson: But could Bart have gotten those eggs?
Lunchlady Dora: No way. They were under lock and key.
Lunchlady Dora: No one could've touched those eggs except me and the seagulls that laid 'em.
Lisa Simpson: (SMUG, VICTORIOUS) No further questions.
Janet Reno: Ah, to be young and on trial.
Cat Lady: (CAT LADY NOISES)
(Burns Manor: Int. BurnS' MANSION - night)
C. Montgomery Burns: A toast, to our enigmatic new protector -- (COY) who certainly isn't me! Smithers, wink my eye!
Justine: Wanna hit the hot tub, Burnsie?
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, I hate to get all pruney, but heated tubbery is what we playboys do!
Waylon Smithers: Great work, everyone! That's a wrap!
Carl Carlson: It's nice to make an old man feel good about himself.
Lenny Leonard: You said it.
(Springfield Elementary School: EXT. SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - gym - DAY)
Milhouse Van Houten: So Bart couldn't've taken the eggs. I was with him the whole weekend.
Seymour Skinner: You'd make up any lie for that Simpson boy, wouldn't you?
Milhouse Van Houten: Yeah, but I'd pee my pants.
Seymour Skinner: Nelson?
Nelson Muntz: Dry as a bone.
Krusty the Clown: Now that's what I call legal briefs!
Lisa Simpson: Why are you here?
Bart Simpson: (SMALL SOFT MOAN)
Krusty the Clown: I thought of the joke and rushed over.
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. school - day - establishing)
(GYMNASIUM: Int. gymnasium - continuous)
Lisa Simpson: Your Honor, I think we've seen enough. I have demolished the prosecution's claims and made the prosecutor sweat through two shirts.
Lisa Simpson: I move that you dismiss this case, and release this sweet, lovable boy.
Janet Reno: Motion... denied.
Lisa Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE)
Janet Reno: Miss Simpson, your grandstanding summation contained a grievous error. By calling your brother "sweet and lovable," you opened the door to testimony from anyone who doesn't think he's sweet and lovable.
Seymour Skinner: (LEAPS TO FEET) The prosecution calls everyone in the world!
(Springfield Elementary School: int. springfield elemeNTARY - gym - day)
Seymour Skinner: Mr. Szyslak, what name did the defendant (INDICATING BART) ask for when he called you at your bar?
Moe Szyslak: (SMALL, WOUNDED) He asked for, uh, Mike Rotch.
Seymour Skinner: And then what did you say?
Moe Szyslak: Well, I said, um... I said "Mike Rotch. (VERY WOUNDED) Um, Mike Rotch." And then, I... I'm sorry...
Seymour Skinner: Take all the time you need.
Moe Szyslak: (WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY) I-I-I yelled out, "Has anybody seen Mike Rotch?"
School Courtroom: (CONFUSED MURMURS)
Moe Szyslak: (THROUGH SOBS) You see, they, they thought I was askin'... if anybody wanted to see... my... oh man, this is so painful... (TOTALLY DEVASTATED) my crotch.
School Courtroom: (SHOCKED GASP)
Seymour Skinner: Thank you for your bravery today.
Moe Szyslak: I just had to make sure that he never did this to another bartender.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room - night)
Bart Simpson: Pass the gravy, Gloria Allwrong.
Lisa Simpson: The trial's not over and gravy is dead animal juice.
Lisa Simpson: Just remember this: a Simpson never gives up.
Bart Simpson: (BIG LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: You gotta be kiddin'.
Marge Simpson: (CHUCKLES AGAINST HER WILL)
(Burns Manor: Ext. Burns's mansion - night)
C. Montgomery Burns: (HORRIFIED GASP) A civilian! She mustn't know I'm a hero! Gouge her eyes out!
Bart Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) My wha?
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Burns, I came here because my brother is about to be wrongfully convicted. And the man I'm looking for would help me find the truth.
C. Montgomery Burns: Don't you get it?! I don't care who you are or what you want.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now get lost!
Waylon Smithers: I think you just sent away the first person you could've actually helped.
C. Montgomery Burns: What do you mean "actually?" I've punched out (PUNCHING MOTION) four Homer Simpson-shaped burglars tonight alone.
Waylon Smithers: All those crooks were fakes! Set up by me.
C. Montgomery Burns: (STUNNED GASP) Even the abominable Doctor Lenny?
Waylon Smithers: No, he was a happy accident. But the rest were fakes, just like you. A man who claims to be a hero but is nothing more than a fraud with a cute little bod.
Waylon Smithers: They're calling for you, sir. But who's gonna answer?
Arnie Pye: Agh! What the hell is that?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - laundry room - evening)
Lisa Simpson: And so I've learned that the only true Batmen are Christian Bale and Adam West. Why are you washing Bumblebee Man's pants?
Marge Simpson: I volunteered to wash the egg stains off everyone's clothes. (ROLLS EYES) It's one of those things you say and hope nobody takes you up on it.
Lisa Simpson: That's odd.
Marge Simpson: What's odd?
Lisa Simpson: (QUICK, SERIOUS) This skirt has a small splatter...
Marge Simpson: Splatter?
Lisa Simpson: Splatter, as if the egg had been crushed against it by hand--
Chief Wiggum: I don't follow.
Lisa Simpson: --like someone faked being hit so they wouldn't be a suspect.
Marge Simpson: (QUICK, SERIOUS) Interesting. Except you missed one thing.
Lisa Simpson: What's that?
Marge Simpson: It's not a skirt. (DRAMATICALLY) It's a kilt!
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. Springfield elementary - athletic fields - MORNING)
Groundskeeper Willie: Ah... the wood chipper. Is there any sweeter music?
Marge Simpson: Why'd you do it, Willie?
Groundskeeper Willie: (TERRIFIED NOISE) Because the world is better off with four fewer Welshmen! Wait, what are we talking about?
Lisa Simpson: This kilt says you framed my brother! Why?
Groundskeeper Willie: Because I hate Easter! You see, ladies, I'm not just a Presbyterian.
Groundskeeper Willie: I'm a Scottish, "Old Believer" Presbyterian.
Groundskeeper Willie: Old believers don't recognize holidays not celebrated by the original apostles. Especially one named after the pagan god "Eostre!"
Lisa Simpson: But how did you get the key?
Groundskeeper Willie: I made sweet love to Lunchlady Dora then copied the key as she slept.
(Groundskeeper Willie's Shack: Int. Willie's shack)
Groundskeeper Willie: Now, as for your evidence...
Groundskeeper Willie: (EVIL SCOTTISH LAUGH)
C. Montgomery Burns: (INTENSE) Behold the pointed ears of justice!
Groundskeeper Willie: (TERRIFIED SCREAM) A human fruit bat!
Groundskeeper Willie: He's so light -- it's like fighting a silk scarf... or a kimono sash!
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, feel the weightless tickle of justice!
C. Montgomery Burns: Which side won, good or evil?
Waylon Smithers: Good.
C. Montgomery Burns: And which side was I on?
Waylon Smithers: Also, good.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, there's two surprises!
(Springfield Elementary School: Int. sprINGFIELD ELEMENTARY - GYMNASIUM - continuous)
Janet Reno: Will the defendant please rise?
Homer Simpson: It's amazing how much exercise I've gotten from those words.
C. Montgomery Burns: Pause the inquisition!
School Courtroom: (GASP)
C. Montgomery Burns: Behold the real egg-flinging fiend!
Groundskeeper Willie: Aye, 'tis true. I pulled the prank for some daft Scottish reason.
Gary Chalmers: I'd fire that man if he weren't so damn good at what he does.
Seymour Skinner: We have a school full of professionals, sir.
Gary Chalmers: Really? Where is that school? Inside your head?
Janet Reno: Another mystery solved by Attorney General Janet Reno. Case dismissed!
Bart Simpson: You saved me, Lis! For the rest of my life, you'll always be my "one phone call."
Lisa Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aw... but I do hope you'll try to be good from now on.
Bart Simpson: Don't need to. I've got you.
Janet Reno: Children, let me be clear: despite what happened here, last-minute confessions, shackled Scotsmen and meddling billionaires are not how the legal system works. Well, the last one is.
Lisa Simpson: Today you were truly a hero. Thank you.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.
Lisa Simpson: You know, if you're gonna be a hero, you might not want to tent your fingers like that.
C. Montgomery Burns: Is this better?
Lisa Simpson: Maybe you should wrap your hands behind your head.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONSIDERING NOISE, THEN FED UP) Maybe I could wrap them around your gabby little throat!
Lisa Simpson: (PANICKED) Ah! Tenting! Tenting! Back to the tenting!

Narrator: (SLIGHTLY SARDONIC VOICE, LIKE NARRATOR IN DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES) What do women want? Throughout the her-story, that's right I said her-story, of planet Herth -- men have attempted to answer that question and failed. Or should I say "maled?"

Homer Simpson: (COY CHUCKLE) Keep it under your hat, guys, but I've got a date with a married woman.

Marge Simpson: (SLIGHTLY-DUBIOUS NOISE)
Diners: (MOANS OF ECSTASY)
Chef Naziwa: Not fresh enough!
Male Diner: (A LITTLE SNOOTY) Can we get some soy sauce?
Akira: (POLITE) We do not recommend soy sauce with that particular roll.
Chef Naziwa: (FURIOUS) NO SOY SAUCE! You... and all your ancestors... banned!
Male Diner: But but I didn't--
Chef Naziwa: Edamame them away!
Male Diner: (SMUG) You really think that's gonna get rid of us?
Chef Naziwa: How you like this soy sauce?! The customer is never right!
Marge Simpson: If they can be that rude, the food must be great!
Male Diner: I was just leaving a tip!
Chef Naziwa: Tip included! (BLASTS AGAIN)
Homer Simpson: Marge, this is amazing. I never realized some restaurants are better than others. (VORACIOUS EATING NOISES)
Akira: I hope you are enjoying your sushi.
Marge Simpson: It's as yummy as your poorly-produced local commercial said.
Akira: I argued against that cowboy hat, but in the end, it worked.
Marge Simpson: So without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk.
Homer Simpson: (EATING NOISES) Oh yeah.
Marge Simpson: Uh, I'm thinking of getting Maggie swimming lessons.
Homer Simpson: Beats drowning. (EATING NOISES)
Marge Simpson: (SHORT BEAT, THEN:) When God rested on the seventh day, did He take a nap or do a hobby He enjoyed?
Marge Simpson: (LOSING IT) I think I'm interesting!
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) What? What? You're interesting. Why would you say that?
Marge Simpson: (DISGUSTED) Can you chew with your mouth closed? It's like looking into a garbage disposal.
Homer Simpson: (SAD) Words hurt, you know.
Marge Simpson: (SAD NOISE) The most romantic part of this was the hold music when I made the reservation.
Homer Simpson: Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally, the Kissing Walrus.
Homer Simpson: (AMOROUS WALRUS NOISES)
Narrator: Everything has its breaking point... even the strongest substance in the universe... a married mother of three.
Marge Simpson: That usually works, but not today.
Homer Simpson: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous.
Homer Simpson: Conversation, conversation... you look great.
Homer Simpson: And uh, how was your day?
Marge Simpson: Lousy.
Homer Simpson: You can't spell "lousy" without "us."
Marge Simpson: I'm going to take a cab.
Homer Simpson: Marge, wait!
Homer Simpson: Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other.
Marge Simpson: I'm not going to sleep!
Homer Simpson: Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch. (STIFLES A YAWN)
Homer Simpson: Oh my God! A marriage so perfect that I could take it for granted for years, suddenly explodes. What do I do?! What do I do?!
Narrator: For a man confronted with danger, two responses immediately come to mind.
Homer Simpson: I like that picture of the sneaker with wings. I'm gonna flee!
Homer Simpson: (PANTS, THEN:) Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?
Homer Simpson: (DRAMATIC) Fleeing didn't work. I have no choice. I will have to... (POWERFUL) do whatever the other thing was!!!

Milhouse Van Houten: Sure! I've got goulash, schnitzel, salmagundi...
Lisa Simpson: Ooh, a cupcake!
Milhouse Van Houten: Oh yeah... um... do you want it?

Milhouse Van Houten: You heard me, Duchess. It's mine and I'm saving it.
Lisa Simpson: Oh. Okay. If you'll excuse me, I have to go think of you in a different light.
Milhouse Van Houten: (SADLY) Great. She's never gonna talk to me again.
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry I was inconsiderate, Milhouse. And furthermore, I respect you more for saying "no."
Milhouse Van Houten: (CHUCKLES TO SELF) Tell ya what, babe. Why don't you get me a milk?
Bart Simpson: (WHISPERED) Milhouse, where are you going with this?
Milhouse Van Houten: Playing the biggest hunch of my life.
Lisa Simpson: (RETURNING) I just have one thing to say...

Lisa Simpson: (SWOONS)
Milhouse Van Houten: Who knew having a backbone was attractive?
Seymour Skinner: Certainly not I. It would change the way my suits fit.
Lisa Simpson: Milhouse, you'll probably think this is lame, but I was gonna go for a nature walk after school and I thought maybe you'd like to...
Milhouse Van Houten: Just start nature-walking. See if I show up.

Marge Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) From the gas station?
Homer Simpson: (PROUDLY) From the place beside the gas station!
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Well, that does sound good...
Marge Simpson: I'll just stick this in your apology card drawer.
Marge Simpson: No! I'm tired of your broken promises! "Marge, I'm gonna lose ten pounds." "Sweetie, I'll be home at eight p.m." "Sweetie, I'll be home at eight a.m." (MEANINGFUL BEAT) "I'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life." I'm done!

Milhouse Van Houten: (IMITATING BRANDO) Whatever. Did you bring me that sandwich what I sent you out for?
Lisa Simpson: (HOLDS UP SANDWICH) It came with fries or salad.
Milhouse Van Houten: (IMITATING BRANDO) Whichever you picked, you picked wrong.
Lisa Simpson: Well I wasn't sure, so I got both. (ADORING CHUCKLE) Who knows her little Milhouse?

Milhouse Van Houten: (PANICKED) Where is the bunny?!
School Therapist: He's in the closet. He's fine.
School Therapist: I'm over here, Milhouse. Focus.

Homer Simpson: (SAD NOISE) I can't please any woman.
Lisa Simpson: Milhouse, I'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so I made cookies. But I didn't know what kind you liked, so I made you seven kinds. (GASPS) I've become my mother! (IMITATING MARGE:) Well, common sense never goes out of style (MARGE-LIKE MURMUR, THEN BACK TO LISA PANICKED) That was too easy!

Marge Simpson: This list is from six years ago.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Well, you know how in the Special Olympics they give medals just for showing up?

Homer Simpson: Marriage is so tough. Every second it could explode catastrophically. Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.
Chef Naziwa: I say marriage is like fish. There are parts so delicious they could've been sliced from angels...and parts we make into omakase.
Homer Simpson: Omakase? (TRYING TO RECALL) Where have I heard that word before?
Chef Naziwa: You haven't! Now finish your omakase.

Homer Simpson: Woo hoo! I'll woo her with woo-hoo!
Moe Szyslak: Ah y'know, if this is what women like, I should be a lot more popular. But it does inspire me to work on my fan fiction.
Moe Szyslak: "Sheriff Andy took Barney in his arms and kissed him deeply, then said: (IMITATING ANDY GRIFFITH, BUT STERN) 'now if Aunt Bee asks, we were down at the fishin' hole'." (MOE VOICE) I can't be the only one who likes this.

Marge Simpson: Homer, I'm glad that you tried, even though now I can't find the washing machine.
Homer Simpson: It's behind the Dingle Swing.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh.
Homer Simpson: So, you forgive me?
Marge Simpson: Not because of what you bought, but because I realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying. And there's nothing a woman loves more than that.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED NOISE) Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?
Marge Simpson: Actually I'm cool with one of them.

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (CLEARS THROAT)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: The Epistle of Jeremy is often cited as the most difficult book of the Apocrypha. But to me, none of the anagignoskomena are more contemplative than the book of Tobit.
Springfielders: (SHOCKED EXCITED GASPS)
Parson: Mind if I pray through?

Parson: Are you gonna let a sunny summer day be ruined by a few (BING CROSBY) bu-bu-bu-bugs?
Sideshow Mel: God's soldier in cardigan!
Parson: (TO CROWD) Looks like I picked a swell day to return your six iron, Reverend.
Parson: Now lookie here, Tim. This is a five-alarm brouhaha. Now, for chili, that's just dandy, but I brought you a little backup.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I think I'm more than capable of handling this.
Parson: Need I remind you of the Bingo riot last summer?
Parson: God called all their numbers that day.
Parson: (TO CONGREGATION) Please meet your new Associate Minister, the Right Reverend Elijah Hooper. He was the number two man from Shelbyville. Introduced angle parking. We got in six more cars!
Rev. Hooper: Folks, isn't he something, big hand for Reverend Lovejoy.
Rev. Hooper: Everyone says great things about you, Tim. And I can see why -- the posture, the haircut, the tiny feet -- it's amazing they hold you up, but they do. (CHUCKLES) They do.
Marge Simpson: So charming. It's like he's selling silver polish at the state fair.
Rev. Hooper: Look, here's why I'm here. Church should make you happy, like a warm mug of soup. Why does it taste better from a mug? I don't know, but it does.
Lenny Leonard: God help me, I'm paying attention!
Rev. Hooper: Okay, who here has read "Leviticus?"

Rev. Hooper: Hilarious film, showed a whole new side of De Niro.
Krusty the Clown: Where's my mail-order bride?
Rev. Hooper: At first he couldn't stand his son-in-law, but then they patched things up in a comical fashion. Remember? The point is, at the end of the day, we love each other.
Rev. Hooper: And that's all this thing really says.
Rev. Hooper: So don't waste your whole Sunday listening to us. Go home and watch one of the Die Hard movies on TV. They're always on, and they're always good.
Rev. Hooper: And ladies, drop in on a neighbor's open house just to see what they did with their sun room.

Lenny Leonard: Easy Moe, easy!
Moe Szyslak: Oh, this thing's just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses.
Homer Simpson: Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn't.
Homer Simpson: And if it's such a (AIR QUOTES) "Good Book," how come there's no blurbs on the back? Not even David Sedaris? And he'll flack anything!
Homer Simpson: Seriously, "Pews?"
Rev. Hooper: Homer, I love your passion. It's terrific, it's really something. Listen -- I'm just thinking -- would you consider being my deacon?
Homer Simpson: Deacon? (SUSPICIOUS) Is that like one of those weird Catholic Priest things?
Rev. Hooper: No, not at all. It's like a sexton, or a rector.
Homer Simpson: Oh, now we're talkin'. But why me?
Rev. Hooper: Because if I can get the man who sleeps through church to be my guy, this town will know that religion can be fun.
Homer Simpson: Well I'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. But as we say in the snow plow business, "I'm your astronaut"!
Marge Simpson: What do you think?
Patty Bouvier: I didn't think Shotgun Mike's Bridal Store had a nice dress, but you found it.

Grampa Simpson: (MAD) Well, why the hell am I down here?
Bart Simpson: (PLEADING) I was supposed to be in charge of you. I can't let Mom and Dad know what I did. But I promise I'll take good care of you until you're well again.
Grampa Simpson: No deal! I'm gettin' outta here!

Moe Szyslak: Uh, I didn't go to movies as a kid. Spent all my time at the pierógi factory. Dab the potato, fold the dough. That was my Star Wars.
Marge Simpson: Well, Dumbo had a magic feather. He thought he needed it to fly, but it turned out the magic was in him the whole time.
Lisa Simpson: So you're saying Moe's Dumbo, his bourbon is the giant ears, and we're that flock of racist crows?

Bart Simpson: No. Even she thought it was crap.

Vigorous Older Man: No, just a regular hairless Joe like you. Been bald since I was twenty-three. With the money I've saved I bought a yacht.
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED) You're cool with it? I haven't even told my wife.
Vigorous Older Man: You wait for the right moment, you show her that glorious dome, and then you rest it sweetly on her bosom and let the kisses flow like rain.
Homer Simpson: Wow, is that what your wife did?

Marge Simpson: I signed you up for the Ten-And-Below Talent Show next week!
Bart Simpson: You know, I'm almost eleven, it's not really fair.

Lenny Leonard: Nineteen for me! And for the best year of my life: nineteen ninety-six.
Carl Carlson: My number's twenty-two. No reason. Just twenty-two.

Moe Szyslak: Oh... I guess Carl ain't back yet from cashin' in the ticket.
Lenny Leonard: I'm sure he just got held up in traffic.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, that's probably what happened.
Lenny Leonard: I wonder what's keeping Carl?
Homer Simpson: I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.
Moe Szyslak: I'm glad we're the kind of people who are worried about Carl's safety instead of thinking that he ripped us off.
Homer Simpson: I wasn't thinking that! Carl's our good friend.
Lenny Leonard: Our good friend!
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, good old Carl.

Marge Simpson: I still can't believe it was Carl who took your winnings. I thought it would have been (POINTS TO MOE) you, (POINTS TO LENNY) or you, (POINTS TO HOMER) or you.
Homer Simpson: I know, me too. It's the ultimate screw-over.
Marge Simpson: Maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.
Lisa Simpson: He said he went home, and his passport is gone. What country is he from?
Moe Szyslak: (PERPLEXED NOISES)
Marge Simpson: You don't know where Carl is from?
Homer Simpson: Come on, you know how dudes are. We don't go digging into the past. We talk about guy stuff.
Lenny Leonard: ("SEE?") You know, guy stuff.
Marge Simpson: Maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff you'd know more about your so-called friend.

Male Icelander: This saga tells of how Carl Carlson's family were the watchmen of the coast, always keeping an eye out for invading hordes. Iceland's safety depended on their vigilance.
Male Icelander: But the Carlsons failed in their duty. The enemy invaded, laying waste to our lava fields, burning our sweaters, and feasting upon our tiny horses.

Carl Carlson: (CRACKING) No, no, anything but the inedible, repulsive food of my native land!
Lenny Leonard: Yeah Carl, tell them the good reason you had for borrowing the money.
Carl Carlson: Look, I admit it. I gave you the ultimate screw over. But I did it to clear my family's name. Everyone blames the barbarian invasion on my ancestors. But that saga had a missing page.
Lenny Leonard: Oh yeah... a page was torn out.
Carl Carlson: My family's always believed that we fought bravely against the invaders, and the missing page will prove it! I took the lottery money to buy that page and restore my family's honor.
Lenny Leonard: Why didn't you just tell us? We're your friends.
Carl Carlson: I didn't tell you because... we're not friends!
Lenny Leonard: (HUGE GASP)
Carl Carlson: Friends share their feelings, their hopes, their dreams! Friends know their friends are from Iceland! We are just guys who sit next to each other at a bar and talk about (DISGUSTED) guy stuff.
Lenny Leonard: (HURT) So all those years of hanging out... meant nothing?
Carl Carlson: (LOOKS DOWN) Not to me.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Lenny.

Carl Carlson: My eye!
Lenny Leonard: My eye!
Carl Carlson: My eye!
Lenny Leonard: My eye!
Moe Szyslak: Hey, hey, hey, Lenny, forget him, forget him! Look, we still got the money.
Homer Simpson: What the hell is this?
Carl Carlson: That's the missing page from the saga. That's what I spent our lottery money on.
Lenny Leonard: Then this belongs to us!
Carl Carlson: Please, give it back! Please! It'll restore my family's honor!
Lenny Leonard: Maybe we'd give it back to our friend, but we're not friends, remember?

Homer Simpson: Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.
Moe Szyslak: I say we make it into saga soup and have ourselves a soup sip.
Lenny Leonard: That'll show Carl for de-friending us in real life!
Marge Simpson: I know Carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?

Homer Simpson: "When the barbarian invaders came, the Carlsons met them with their weapons ready"...
Lenny Leonard: Wow, Carl's family really was brave!
Homer Simpson: ..."weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. The Carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders.
Homer Simpson: The Carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice."
Homer Simpson: (REALIZING) Carl's family was even worse than people thought.
Moe Szyslak: They were the original ultimate scumbags!

Male Icelander: Yes.
Homer Simpson: I've learned something about the people of Iceland. You've endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse, and a lesbian prime minister.
Homer Simpson: You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. And to do that, you have to be stubborn.
Homer Simpson: But I ask you to put aside your stubbornness while I tell you about Carl Carlson...
Male Icelander: Shame on Carl's family!
Female Icelander: The blood of a thousand tiny horses is on their hands!
Homer Simpson: It doesn't matter what happened a thousand years ago. For Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.
Lenny Leonard: Carl Carlson who helped me move, even though I moved the week before.
Icelanders: (SMALL IMPRESSED NOISES)
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, and when we were painting my house, Carl Carlson brought that blue tape, you know that really makes you look like you know what you're doing. You peel it off, and you got that super-straight line there.
Icelanders: (BIGGER IMPRESSED NOISES)
Homer Simpson: And when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him. Carl Carlson leaves them in the fridge.
Icelanders: (HUGE IMPRESSED NOISES)
Lenny Leonard: Carl Carlson is our friend. Even if he doesn't believe it.

Wise Old Icelander: The many small kindnesses of Carl Carlson have redeemed his family forever!
Carl Carlson: Mom, Dad, our family can show our face in public for the first time in a thousand years.

Homer Simpson: Yep, we've got something money can't buy - love on a train. And I promise each anniversary will be better and better...
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED NOISE)
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: (REACHING FOR CONTROL) They have to get off and get back on.
Supervisor: (GRUFF) Sometimes you have to say to hell with rules.
(THE SAME MALL: Ext. the same mall - day)
Homer Simpson: (CONCERNED) But somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.
Lisa Simpson: Wait... you named me after a train?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, just like we did with Bart. Anyway, this year I'm gonna recreate our magical first anniversary, ending with a romantic ride on that... (GASPS)
Homer Simpson: Why are you taking away the train?
Worker: (WISEGUY) I'm afraid no one rides it anymore despite millions in government subsidies. So we're replacing it with something that makes money and sends people to the food court.
Hippie-looking Guy: (HIPPIE CARNY BARKER VOICE) Step right up! Medical marijuana! You got nausea, my friend? Everyone's got nausea!
Hippie-looking Guy: And what is your malady, my son?
Otto Mann: Uh... I had one, but I forgot it.
Hippie-looking Guy: Memory loss! Could be a brain tumor! Take this and go see Fantasia!
Homer Simpson: Kids, I've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. (TO WORKER) Sir, I need this train!
Worker: (SHRUGS) Take it home, it's yours.
Marge Simpson: (PANICKED) Oooohhh, I'm going to Hell!
Lisa Simpson: Are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?
Homer Simpson: She won't see it like this. I'll make this train look as beautiful as it did when this mall was young.
Lisa Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aww, Dad, I just got a little twinge in my heart.
Otto Mann: Try this.
Homer Simpson: You stay away from my kids unless you're driving them to school!
Otto Mann: So I'm not babysitting tomorrow night?
Homer Simpson: (QUICKLY) Oh, we're still on for tomorrow night.
(Street: Ext. street - a little later)
Lisa Simpson: (CALLING OUT FROM TRAIN CAR) Dad! Do we have to ride like this?
Homer Simpson: Hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?
Jimbo Jones: Hey babies! Where you goin' in your baby train? Babytown?
Kearney Zzyzwicz: (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: Shake it off kids, they're just jealous!
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Hey Lardo! Where're you goin' in your Lardo car? Lardville?
Homer Simpson: (MAD) There's no such place!
(Simpson Home: int. SIMPSON house - KITCHEN - day)
Marge Simpson: Okay, I've entered my billing address... expiration date... and charged!
Patty Bouvier: We're back from "Baby Beethovens."
Patty Bouvier: That's Mozart, dummy.
Marge Simpson: Well, thanks for watching Maggie. I just ordered Homer's anniversary gift.
Patty Bouvier: Must be tough.
Selma Bouvier: Yeah, what size cufflinks do you get an elephant?
Marge Simpson: Well in the first place, the elephant's cufflinks would be the same size. It's the cuffs that would be bigger. As for Homer, I'm getting him a case of his favorite snack cakes, Dolly Madison.
Selma Bouvier: Marge -- this isn't Dolly Madison. (KNOWING) It's Sassy Madison.
Marge Simpson: Trust me, Homer doesn't care where the cupcakes come from.
Patty Bouvier: Sassy Madison is a dating site...for married people who are tired of the same old dessert.
Marge Simpson: (HUGE GASP)
Patty Bouvier: Check out their webvertisement.
Female Singer: (SINGS) KELLY WAS AT THE END OF HER WITS / HER HUSBAND WAS TRULY THE PITS
Female Singer: (SINGS) HER RELATIONSHIP SPOUSAL / HAD ZERO AROUSAL
Female Singer: (SINGS) THEN SHE WATCHED THIS COMMERCIAL / AND FOUND HERSELF HERSCHEL...
Female Singer: (SINGS) THANKS TO SASSY MADISON DOT COM!
SMOOTH ANNOUNCER: Sassy Madison dot com. It's not cheating if you don't know the person well.
Marge Simpson: I just put all my personal information on their website!
Selma Bouvier: So now you're gonna get hit on by every loser in town.
Patty Bouvier: And this town's got losers like Mexico has headless corpses.
Marge Simpson: So many unhappy men. How sad.
Selma Bouvier: You've got a lot of fish wriggling in that net. Maybe I should get married so I can date these guys.
Marge Simpson: Selma, cheating is a sin. As much a sin as not replying to an instant message. So, if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of sleazy gentlemen to let down gently!
Patty Bouvier: Are you watching the commercial again?
Marge Simpson: I'm a fan of animation.
(Back Room of Moe's: Int. Moe's back room - day)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (SHUTS EYES) Oh Lord, may thy couplings stay forever locked, and may thy dead man switch never be used.
Moe Szyslak: Amen.
Carl Carlson: All right, guys, let's get this train fixed up for Homer's anniversary!
Moe Szyslak: But first... start your power tools!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - night - establishing)
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) One more to go and I'm done.
Marge Simpson: "Dear 'Horny in Haverbrook,' sorry, I am not interested in cheating on my wonderful husband, who is described in the attached PDF. Say hello to my trash folder, Marge Simpson."
Marge Simpson: Hi, Homie! A crazy thing happened when I was ordering your anniversary gift.
Homer Simpson: Uh... anniversary? That comin' up?
Marge Simpson: Yes. And it's a big one. Remember?
Homer Simpson: Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. (GIGGLES) "Laser." That's a funny word. It's just "loser" with an "a." And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see-- (SHORT SCREAM)
Homer Simpson: The surprise is safe! The expression on her face will be priceless!
Marge Simpson: (FIRMLY) Save that sugar for your coffee, Bub.
Marge Simpson: (MOANS) He forgot our anniversary again? He remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.
Homer Simpson: Currently: zero.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED MURMUR) One of those cyber smoochers wrote me back...
Ben: Thanks for your note. You seem way too nice for this site. Why are you here?
Marge Simpson: Good question.
Marge Simpson: I thought I was buying snack cakes!
Ben: That's so cute. Really, really cute. You are over eighteen, right?
Marge Simpson: I am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband!
Ben: I know what it's like not to be listened to. Please ignore every sensible instinct you have and continue this conversation. (SMOOTH) And by the way, this is my real voice.
Homer Simpson: (ON PHONE) Don't worry, Moe. When Marge is asleep, I'll sneak back.
Moe Szyslak: Ooh, good! The strippers are here.
Moe Szyslak: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah! That is all comin' off!
Marge Simpson: (AGGRAVATED NOISE)
Marge Simpson: "Tell me more."
Marge Simpson: (NERVOUS MURMURS, THEN:) Homie, I bet you're wondering why I stayed on the computer until four a.m.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves. Did you know a well-placed one star can destroy a mom and pop hardware in nothing flat?
Marge Simpson: Listen, I want us to be honest with each other.
HOMER THOUGHTS: Thinking is your department, jerk! That's what I pay you in beer for!
HOMER THOUGHTS: (ANGRY SPUTTERS) What? Where're your going? I--
Homer Simpson: Um, Marge, I have to go.
Marge Simpson: What? Now? Why?
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
(Supermarket: Int. supermarket - later)
Marge Simpson: He's writing me again! Better put a stop to this.
Marge Simpson: Is that him, getting the text?
Marge Simpson: (SCARED WHISPER) He's in the market! (AGHAST) We might've squeezed the same tomatoes!
Ben: (LOUD WHISPER) Are you Marge?
Homer's Thoughts: (GENUINELY PUZZLED) What train?
Ben: I'm sorry, I didn't even know you were here. What a crazy coincidence that you buy food too.
Marge Simpson: Gee, I thought you'd be some kind of creep. But you're actually a perfectly normal-looking--
Ben: Whoa! (TO MAGGIE) "A" is for "apple," right?
Ben: (INTIMIDATED) O-kay. I'll just be going.
Marge Simpson: Wait, wait, wait! (SIGHS) Let me get the stain out. But not here...
Marge Simpson: I know a place where no one in town will see us.
Marge Simpson: (QUICK VIGOROUS SCRUBBING NOISES, THEN) There you go. Good as new.
Ben: Now, let me at least buy you a coffee, or dare I say... a Danish?
Marge Simpson: No Danishes!
Ben: Sorry, I go to pastry way too fast.
Marge Simpson: I want to be very clear. I'm a happily married woman. Going on ten years. The aluminum anniversary! Nothing turns leftovers into swans like aluminum!
Marge Simpson: What the heck am I saying? Homer's probably at that bar right now, getting hammered.
(Back Room of Moe's: int. moe's back room - (meanwhile))
Homer Simpson: (AGONIZED SCREAM, THEN CHEERFUL) All worth it for Marge!
(Supermarket Coffee Shop: int. supermarket coffee shop - CONTINUOUS)
Ben: Marge, you are terrific. I am so glad I reset my distance filter from fifteen to twenty-five miles.
Marge Simpson: (UNSURE FLATTERED NOISE)
Ben: Your Homer is the luckiest man on earth.
Marge Simpson: Well, he keeps falling down a cliff and living, so I guess that's true.
Ben: The only time my wife and I talk is when I apologize. "Life's an infernal muddle," as Mr. Drake says on "Upton Rectory."
Marge Simpson: Ooh, I love that show!
Ben: (RE: BAG) Isn't it great? Finally, a reason to watch TV on Sundays.
Marge Simpson: Such great characters, like Buxton the scheming larder-keep. Why can't Lady Cavendish see he's pilfering the aspic?
Ben: (SHUDDERS) Uh, does, does Homer watch?
Marge Simpson: He says shows set during World War One are too sad. Particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs.
Ben: You are watching the season finale this week, right?
Marge Simpson: Yeah. Alone, I'm sure.
Ben: Well, we could... (MEANINGFUL) live blog it.
Homer Simpson: (SINGS) I'VE BEEN WORKIN' ON THE RAILROAD...
Marge Simpson: Why are you singing that?
Homer Simpson: Because it's in the public domain?
Marge Simpson: Hello! (HOLDS OUT PHONE TO HOMER) It's Moe from Moe's Tavern.
Homer Simpson: Oh, uh, I'd better take this. Y'see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. (DISARMING CHUCKLE, THEN INTO PHONE, MAD) Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!
(Back Room of Moe's: int. moe's back room - continuous)
Moe Szyslak: Lovejoy went to get a hamburger and the whole thing fell apart!
Lenny Leonard: I'm gettin' cooked like a cabbage!

Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) All right, all right, I'll be right there!
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS ANGRILY)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - TV room - sunday night)
Marge Simpson: (SMILES) Is it me or did this house just get classy?
Bart Simpson: Mom! Lisa made me break a lamp!
Lisa Simpson: Mom! Bart's twisting facts in an Orwellian fashion!
Marge Simpson: Can I have one hour of grownup time where you two aren't tattling on each other or using obscure references?
Lisa Simpson: Orwell, obscure? The author of "Animal Farm?"
Bart Simpson: (CUPPING HIS HAND, CONFIDENTIAL) Grampa says he was a Commie.
Marge Simpson: (SNAPPING) No tattling!
(Master Bedroom: int. master bedroom - continuous)
Pbs Announcer: (PBS VOICE) Upton Rectory is made possible by a sizeable endowment from Hooters Restaurants, and a generous grant from man named Generous Grant.
Marge Simpson: (QUIETLY) Are you watching it?
(Ben's Bedroom: int. ben's bedroom - continuous)
Ben: No. I can't. My wife's watching a reality show about a man who repossesses zoo animals.
Ramona: (BRASSY) C'mon, taser that flamingo!
Ben: Can't believe I'm missing the finale.
Marge Simpson: (THINKS) Hmm... Maybe I can help.
Mr. Drake: (BRITISH) Bless it all, Polly, I love you! And we shall be wed, by Boxing Day Eve, a.k.a. Christmas.
Polly: (QUICK, IRISH) But Lord Upton has forbidden it, on the grounds that he once saw me exchange pleasantries with the Egyptian Riding Master.
Marge Simpson: Can you follow everything okay?
Fireman: (SMILING) All right.
Ben: I guess sometimes you just don't end up with the person you're supposed to.
Patty Bouvier: Marge, can I use your free Amazon shipping?
Marge Simpson: Not a good time!
Patty Bouvier: (DOPPLER) I know your password!
Lord Upton: (UPPER CLASS BRITISH) Drake... Polly... perhaps I was too hasty.
Polly: (GASP)
Marge Simpson: (SPIT-TAKE)
Lord Upton: Love should flower, even an ill-advised alliance between a coarse Irish maid and a man who once served me soup from the wrong side.
Polly: (IRISH) He hasn't been the same since the war, Lord Upton.
Lord Upton: Hush, Polly. Whom you marry is none of your concern.
Elderly Woman: ("MAGGIE SMITH") I have something to say!
Marge Simpson: The dowager grandmum!
DOWAGER GRANDMUM: (STERN) I'm afraid you cannot marry without a proper ring.
DOWAGER GRANDMUM: (SWEET) Take mine. The Star of Bombay.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (MAD) Once again, India is denuded of her treasure by the imperialist devils.
Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon: Why do we watch this show?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Because I like the costumes!
Ben: (SATISFIED SIGHS)
Marge Simpson: I've never felt so flushed after watching public television.
Ben: Maybe sometime... we could... watch it in the same room.
Marge Simpson: Chat room?
Ben: Room room.
Marge Simpson: Show's over! (SLAMS LAPTOP SHUT) Whoo! That turned ultra-steamy in a jiff!
Ben: I can still hear you.
Marge Simpson: (SCREAMS)
Ben: Still hear you.

Homer Simpson: (NOISE OF GREAT AGONY) Boy, oh boy!
Homer Simpson: (NOISES OF GREAT PAIN) Marge, I threw my back out. Can you please refill this prescription right away?
(GRETCHEN'S APARTMENT: Int. Gretchen's apartment - night)
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Where's it from?
Homer Simpson: It's in Drugtown. Not the nice part.
Marge Simpson: That'll take hours! On our anniversary!
Homer Simpson: And what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: "for worse."
Homer Simpson: (GIDDY) It's working. (DECISIVE:) She's gone! (CALLING OUT) All right, everyone, magically appear!
Homer Simpson: Wow, Moe. Great shrub costume.
Moe Szyslak: Yeah. I sell 'em on the internet for like-minded people. Now let's lay some track.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED) You guys are the best. I just want you to know when I'm holding Marge in my arms tonight, I'll be thinking of all of you.
Homer's Friends: (CHEER, THEN GROSSED-OUT NOISE)

(Car: Int. car - continuous)
Marge Simpson: (MUTTERING) When does it get better? When he's eight hundred pounds and has to be cut out of the house to go to a movie?
800-Pound Homer: (SAD) I lost my cleaning stick in my belly fat. But I found a kitten.
Marge Simpson: (KIND) That is so sweet! (MAD) There I go again, settling!
Thought Bubble Ben: Marge, run off with me. Bring your kid.
Marge Simpson: I have three kids.
Thought Bubble Ben: Whoa, you really went all in with this guy, didn't you?
Marge Simpson: Get out of my head!
Ben: I guess this is goodbye then.
Ben: (SINGS) SOMEDAY / WHEN I'M AWFULLY LOW / WHEN THE WORLD IS COLD
Marge Simpson: I said no!
Ben: Fine. Sorry.
Ben: (SINGS) JUST THINKING OF YOU, MARGE...AND THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT. (SPOKEN) The Nelson Riddle Orchestra!
Marge Simpson: Leave me alone!
Ben: (DEJECTED) Fine. (TO ORCHESTRA) Sorry, guys, you're dead again.
Marge Simpson: I'm gonna do what I've done at every key point of my life: suck it in and smile.
Chief Wiggum: There goes a woman who's unhappy with her partner.
Lou: I know how she feels.
Chief Wiggum: What was that?
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - EVENING)
Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED) What the?
Lisa Simpson: Happy anniversary!
Marge Simpson: Oh my God. Our train! Homie you do care. You care a lot!
Marge Simpson: What a wonderful anniversary.
Homer Simpson: You think we'll last twenty-five years?
Bart Simpson: (TO CAMERA) Nothing should.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Trains. They can fix every marriage.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ugh. Happy moment derailed by the bi-polar express. (LOOKS AROUND) None of you heard that.
Crowd: (CHEERS) Happy anniversary!
Ramona: Where is she? Where the hell is Marge Simpson?
Ben: Ramona, please! When you asked me who she was and where she lived, I never dreamed you'd go confront her.
Marge Simpson: (NERVOUS NOISE) I'm Marge Simpson.
Ramona: So, you're the kind of man-eater Hall and Oates warned us all about.
Homer Simpson: (WALKS UP) Hall and Oates? What's going on here?!
Ramona: Your wife and my husband have been watching British TV together.
Homer Simpson: Costume drama or naughty comedy?
Marge Simpson: (SEPARATING THEM) Drama! Drama!
Homer Simpson: You just dodged a bullet, Mister Sugarpants.
Marge Simpson: Ben, Ramona, I wanna tell you something I've learned over ten years of marriage. The secret is: no secrets, except good secrets like this train.
Homer Simpson: My only secrets are my marathon time isn't four twenty-six, it's never; I often go online to see how Lindsay Wagner's looking now - fabulous; and I once pushed a kid off a swing and he broke his wrist or something. But it's no secret how much I love my Margie.
Ramona: Look at them, coochie cooing like that time our connecting flight was delayed and we got drunk and friendly in the Admiral's Club.
Ben: That was you? I mean, (STAMMERS) it was wonderful. And you're fighting for me. Maybe that means you still care.
Ramona: Of course I do. Now let's go home and spend a romantic night looking through your computer's browsing history.
Ben: That exists? Oh boy.
Homer Simpson: Honey... just what was going on with you and that guy?
Marge Simpson: Well, I was trying to buy you snack cakes...

Marge Simpson: Eat up.
Bart Simpson: (SMOOTHLY) The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Lisa Simpson: That's not right.
Bart Simpson: Yes it is, they're my lines as the scarecrow in "The Wizard of Oz."
Homer Simpson: Okay. I'm ready for the Nuclear Workers Convention! It's a little sad. The guys who did the funny skit last year well, they're all very sick.

Marge Simpson: Homie! What happened to you?
Homer Simpson: I overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight.
Marge Simpson: Why didn't you call us?
Homer Simpson: All the payphones at the airport were replaced by self-serve yogurt. I had all the cookie dough toppings a man could want.
Marge Simpson: Well, what made you--
Bart Simpson: (SOMBER) So many cookies will never be born...
Marge Simpson: Well... I guess all that matters is everything's back to normal.
Homer Simpson: (VERY FLAT) Yes, back to normal.
Marge Simpson: Dear Christian God...

Marge Simpson: Amen.
Lisa Simpson: I'm glad you're back, Dad. It's hard to sleep with one un-kissed cheek.

Bart Simpson: More like the "Expandables"! (CHUCKLES)
Bart Simpson: Why didn't you strangle me?

Homer Simpson: I'm not blowing up the plant. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.
Lisa Simpson: Is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
Homer Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Yes, my terrorist masters are always talking about you, Lisa.
Homer Simpson: I missed my flight so I got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. They wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, I had the ass.
Homer Simpson: They taught me something I found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. This t-shirt lied to me!

Lisa Simpson: I've told you that a million times!
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Aw, sweetie, you've told me a thousand things a million times. Even with a brain the size of a dinosaur's, I couldn't take that in.
Homer Simpson: Anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken.
Homer Simpson: Both sold to me by Apu this morning.

Lisa Simpson: A gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler. It doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler. So if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel.
Bart Simpson: (SPEEDS UP AS HE GOES) But if the gumbamel should ramble, then stumble, then just hop atop a Krustiferous Krumbull. But then if that Krumbull should happen to tumble, just call your amigo, the bee man of bumble. (DEEP EXHALE)

Marge Simpson: Poor Chip. Such a big part of everyone's life.
Homer Simpson: (SOMBER) People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.
Hans Moleman: Chip did such a wonderful job with my biography.
Bumblebee Man: (FAST, EXCITED) Chip me ayudó a lidiar con mi pena después que mis padres se murieron jugando paintball!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Chip was the life of Sector Six-F at the nuclear plant...but Chip once confessed to me... he did have a few regrets.
Congregation: (ENORMOUS GASPS)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Chip regretted never ascending Mount Springfield from the south face. He regretted that the high school long jump record he set was wind-aided. We often spoke of that asterisk. He never broke par on hole seventeen at Springfield Mini Golf.
Patty Bouvier: (UNMOVED) Eh, everyone has regrets.
Marge Simpson: Not me!
Patty Bouvier: (SOTTO TO MARGE) You?! Your marriage is a dead fish floating in a tank of stale beer. Your baby's addicted to pacifiers...and your son is out of control!
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Let us kneel...
Joe Namath: My knees! Forty years of healing gone!
Marge Simpson: He's such a little dickens. Although Dickens was pretty well-behaved.
Patty Bouvier: (LOUD WHISPER) He's been screwed up since the moment Homer's D.N.A. staggered into your womb.
Marge Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) I have no regrets about that. It was a perfect pregnancy. Didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds. And every night before bed, Homer would give me a little kiss... music. (GASPS) Could Bart have been prenatally screwed up by the KISS music?

(First Church of Springfield: Int. church - present)
Kent Brockman's Thoughts: Regrets, eh? This local newsman's had a few, covering a town of backwater rubes who for some reason hate my guts.
Kent Brockman: This is Kent Brockman, (SIGHS) live at the Springfield Peach Parade. Sir, could you give us eight seconds of your homespun wisdom?
Cletus Spuckler: It's a little known fact that you can get head lice from peaches. This is my daughter, Peaches.
Kent Brockman: (SIGHS) We'll have more regrets at eleven tonight following an all-new bottle of scotch.
(Alley McBalls: Int. Alley mcballs - day - the past)
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) I'm thinking about it!
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS) That's the coolest bowling ball I've ever seen.
Homer Simpson: Hello, Bear Stearns? I'd like to sell all my Apple stock so I can buy a fancy bowling ball. You heard me. Technology is a fad. Heavy blue balls are the future.
(First Church of Springfield: Int. church - present day)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Now, let us text on our ubiquitous Apple tablets and phones...
Homer Simpson: (SAD MOAN, TO BALL) You cost me a piece of all of that!
Homer Simpson: Aw, don't cry. (BRUSHES TEARS AWAY)
C. Montgomery Burns: If it makes you feel worse, I'm the man who bought the stock you sold.
Homer Simpson: I'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
C. Montgomery Burns: Just one.
C. Montgomery Burns: (WISTFUL) The girl that got away. She broke my first heart.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: So, is there truly anyone among us without regrets?
Agnes Skinner: I have no regrets!

Jasper Beardly: Oh my!
Bart Simpson: My pants, like the Lord, work in mysterious ways.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (ANGRY) Return those vestments!
C. Montgomery Burns: Speaking of return on investments, my Apple stock is up thirty-five hundred percent!
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) You misheard that on purpose!
Ned Flanders: (PANICKY) Tithe denied! Tithe denied!
Marge Simpson: (UPSET) Must find way... to blame myself.
(Marge's Bedroom: Int. Marge's bedroom - the past)
Homer Simpson: (READING) Um... it says I should give you "lumbar support." Better go to the lumberyard...
Marge Simpson: Lumbar! It means lower back. How many times will you make that mistake?
Marge Simpson: Just put on the KISS record.
Marge Simpson: Anything from "Love Gun"!
Homer Simpson: Hey book, are you expecting this?
Homer Simpson: And while I'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!
Homer Simpson: That is a good fire.
Milhouse Van Houten: You're going down, Bart!
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, reckless youth.
Waylon Smithers: He'll be okay.
C. Montgomery Burns: I was referring to him.

Demon: (WAILS)
Lilah: Oh, Monty... you must promise me one thing.
C. Montgomery Burns: Anything she wanted I was willing to do. Anything. Except...
Lilah: All I ask is that you set aside five minutes a day to think of others.
Lilah: (SMALL SOB) I shall find another husband. As good as you are evil.
C. Montgomery Burns: All I have left is my drawing.
C. Montgomery Burns: It looked a lot better in my memory. (THINKS) But do you know what, Smithers? I will find Lilah and win her back... I'll just check with the old gang. Hemingway!
C. Montgomery Burns: Picasso!
C. Montgomery Burns: Matador Juan Belmonte!
C. Montgomery Burns: And Stalin!
C. Montgomery Burns: That man could really put pressure on you.
Rachel Maddow: Hello, Kent.
Milhouse Van Houten: Why are you doin' this, Bart?
Kent Brockman: (GRUMPY) Well, well, well, Rachel Maddow. Everyone came back for Chip's funeral.
Rachel Maddow: I was flying from D.C. to New York, and of course I had the layover in Springfield. How's the gang at Channel Six?
Kent Brockman: Look, let's get this out of the way. Just because we both worked at Channel Six and you made it big and I didn't doesn't mean I'm bitter.
Rachel Maddow: Um... is that your car?
Kent Brockman: Maybe.
Rachel Maddow: Kent, I'm going to tell you the most important mistake you ever made... after this break.
Rachel Maddow: So Kent, that mistake you made? That fundamental life-changing error? That cosmic fail? That--
Kent Brockman: Just tell me already!
Rachel Maddow: After this break.
Rachel Maddow: You could've come with me. But you were suckling the dual teats of infotainment and celebrifawning!
Rachel Maddow: So, tell us about your new movie.
Rainier Wolfcastle: It's fantastic. The studio let us play in their sandbox.
Kent Brockman: Great! We have a clip.
Rainier Wolfcastle: (AGHAST) No! No, don't show it! There aren't five good seconds in the whole film!
(Luigi's: EXT. LUIGI'S - ESTABLISHING - LATER)

Rachel Maddow: Kent, I think I've found my ticket out of this town, or at least to a better Springfield.
Luigi: You two newshounds working on a story? How 'bout this? Mario's down the street found a rat in their pasta.
Kent Brockman: When did that happen?
Luigi: Whenever you want (WINKS) Eh?
Kent Brockman: Rachel, can I come? We can share blazers!
Rachel Maddow: (TO KENT) Just follow me.
Luigi: At Mario's, the picture of Sinatra on the wall... is signed by Frank Junior! The frame hides the Junior!
(Springfield Forest: Ext. springfield FOREST - night)
Rachel Maddow: Someone's been dumping tires in the forest.
Kent Brockman: Willikers! In my three years of soft news, I've never seen anything like this.
Krusty the Clown: Those are tires from my ill-fated Krusty Town Car. It would explode if people gripped the wheel too tightly.
Krusty the Clown: You're not tellin' no one! As the four p.m. clown, I have complete control of Channel Six's news division.
Rachel Maddow: Local news is a joke. I'm going to cable.
Krusty the Clown: (SNEERING) Cable news? Bah! People only want news at six p.m. from white guys on weekdays and black guys on weekends.
Rachel Maddow: We'll see about that. Yes, we shall see. About that, things will be seen. By us. (STARTS TO LEAVE) Kent? You coming?
Krusty the Clown: He ain't comin'. This little piggy's afraid to leave his cushy anchorman slop trough.
Kent Brockman: Could you uh, phrase that a little more nicely?
Krusty the Clown: Sorry. (TO RACHEL) He (AIR QUOTES) "isn't" coming.
Rachel Maddow: You'll regret this Kent, when I have my own show and you're stuck here tracking Santa's flight from the North Pole. Oh look, he's over Greenland.
Krusty the Clown: Don't worry, piggy, you made the right choice.
Krusty the Clown: Eh, it'll burn out in an hour or so.

C. Montgomery Burns: Lilah's alive?!
Dexter Colt: Yeah, well, uh, she's alive, but... she's a nun.
C. Montgomery Burns: Married to Jesus, eh? (HOPEFUL) Does he beat her?
Dexter Colt: Jesus? No, he's a real Eagle Scout, that one. But your penguin's not a Catholic. She's a Buddhist nun. Spent her life expressing her sexuality with a Zen garden.
C. Montgomery Burns: Those raked rocks could've been me! (SNATCHES PHOTOS) Now since you're so good at finding things, find the exit!

Marksman: (DISTANT) Chief, it happened again!
Chief Wiggum: Oh c'mon guys, spread out! Arms length!
Marge Simpson: It's all my fault. I should never have listened to those KISS albums when I was pregnant.
Chief Wiggum: Marge, with all due respect, that's ridiculous. My Sarah listened to Mozart and Churchill speeches when she was pregnant with Ralphie, and he can't even open a refrigerator. Pushing, always, always pushing.
Marge Simpson: (A LITTLE RELIEVED) Really?
Lou: Oh yeah, that kid's a mess.
Chief Wiggum: Hey! Only I get to criticize him, Lou. (SADLY) The kid's scared to flush. He thinks its his brother.
Marge Simpson: Can we focus on my son? Up in the sky?
Professor Jonathan Frink: (WALKING UP) Oh, I've got a long-shot idea. By which I mean firing a shot over a long distance. (FRINK LAUGH)
Professor Jonathan Frink: Yeah, you see, if we could fire an exactly twelve-and-half-pound weight into the basket, it would lower the boy very gently to the ground.
Mayor Joe Quimby: Unfortunately, all our cannonballs were melted down to make a statue of Joe Paterno, which we changed to look like Eugene Levy.

Homer Simpson: I'll handle this. (TALKING AS HE TEXTS) "Dear Weirdo, pick up weirdo kid." And send.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) Did you eat a peanut?
Milhouse Van Houten: No, I just sniffed a nectarine. It's okay. I can breathe through my tear ducts. (ANNOYING WHISTLE, THEN:) Tell me if this gets annoying. (WHISTLES)
Milhouse Van Houten: I think I'm gonna throw up the mac and cheese you fed me. I'm not supposed to have it. That's why I had so much.
Homer Simpson: What the?! (SOTTO TO MARGE) If this kid's Dad isn't here in one second he's going in the garbage can.
Kirk Van Houten: (BRAGGING) Hey guys, who wants a whiff of "New Kirk Smell?"
Marge Simpson: "Yolo?"
Kirk Van Houten: "You Only Live Once."
Homer Simpson: Once again, cats have it better.
Marge Simpson: (TEASING) Kirk Van Houten, I hope you're not having a midlife crisis.
Kirk Van Houten: Please. Just 'cause I bought a new car, lost a little weight and started taking a D.J. class, everyone thinks I'm having a midlife crisis.
Milhouse Van Houten: Dad? You got me a skateboard?

Marge Simpson: You've had the same job, same car, same house for twenty years. And that's all you'll ever have. A cycle you'll never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever change. And you're okay with it!

Seymour Skinner: (SPUTTERING, THEN LAUGHING IT OFF) I thought this was a puff piece! You're wearing a sweater!
Kent Brockman: This journalism just turned... gotcha!
Seymour Skinner: (HORRIFIED GASP)
Kent Brockman: That's right, Channel Six will uncover the truth in a five part series two minutes a day. (TO CREW) People, make room for your local Emmy nomination certificates.
Seymour Skinner: No, do not make room! Except for Mr. Largo and his diet, there is no cheating in this school.

Seymour Skinner: Um... (PRESSES BUTTON) Myra, don't I have another appointment?
Myra: This is your first appointment ever.

Kent Brockman: This school is more corrupt than an Italian parliament! If these children are our future, then I, for one, do not want to live!
Nelson Muntz: (SOFTLY) Haw-haw.
Seymour Skinner: (PLEADING) Please don't air this. I'll tell you the winners of the kickball games in advance -- you can make a lot of cabbage betting on k-ball.

Marge Simpson: Postage, marked in pesetas? Who are those letters from?
Homer Simpson: My old pen pal from Spain. Eduardo.
Homer Simpson: Back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. I picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. We'd write each other with our dreams of the future...

Gary Chalmers: That's it?! That's all you've got? Something I can read on a tea box?
Lisa Simpson: What I'm suggesting is we create an honor code.
Dewey Largo: (GRUMBLING) Oh swell, more work for the teachers.
Lisa Simpson: The students would do it.
Dewey Largo: (STANDS, GESTURES) Let her speak!
Lisa Simpson: If every student pledges not to cheat, and to turn in any cheater, no one will cheat the system because they'll be the system.

Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) May I ask what this is regarding? (LISTENS) Oooh, a budding new friendship? Oooh! (HANDS PHONE TO LISA) Boy, how come you can't get a new friend?
Bart Simpson: What's wrong with the one I got?
Milhouse Van Houten: (ENTERS) I finally got that M&M out of my inner ear. I remembered correctly, it was a green one!
Marge Simpson: Oh, for God's sake.
(Lisa's Bedroom: INT. LISA'S ROOM - MUCH LATER)
Lisa Simpson: And don't you hate being the middle child?
Isabel Gutierrez: This is the first I've heard of it.
Isabel Gutierrez: Yeah, in the car, I always have to sit on the hump. It makes reading impossible.

Lisa Simpson: It's raw veggies, they're supposed to be cold!

Isabel Gutierrez: ...which ran totally counter to America's tradition of limited government. P.S.: It was also unconstitutional.
Lisa Simpson: (STARTLED NOISE)
Lisa Simpson: F.D.R.'s steadfast leadership also helped America win World War Two...
Isabel Gutierrez: ...until the weak-kneed Democrats sold us out at Yalta. If you haven't guessed, Lisa -- I'm a Republican.
Lisa Simpson: (HOPEFUL) A Lincoln Republican?

Lisa Simpson: That isn't a word.
Seymour Skinner: Oooh, back on the saddle she climbs.
Lisa Simpson: I just can't believe someone like you would be a Republican. I mean, isn't your last name Gutiérrez?
Isabel Gutierrez: Just what exactly are you saying?
Lisa Simpson: I'm just saying that people of your heritage... which could be any one of many heritages, I'm not pigeonholing... is it a Catholic thing?
Isabel Gutierrez: I'm a non-observant Jew from Argentina.
Bart Simpson: (PASSING BY) Ay carumba!
Isabel Gutierrez: Do you even know what that means?
Bart Simpson: Um... there's, there's a carumba in my eye?
Isabel Gutierrez: It's the Spanish version of "hot damn."
Bart Simpson: Ay carumba!

Marge Simpson: (VERY PUZZLED NOISE)
Marge Simpson: Lisa? Is everything okay?
Lisa Simpson: Yes, why?

Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) My new best friend isn't what I thought. She's a... (CAN BARELY GET IT OUT) Republican.
Marge Simpson: (GIGGLES)
Lisa Simpson: What is so funny? They're destroying the world!
Marge Simpson: They are, huh?
Marge Simpson: I thought I'd show you this when you were older, but...
Lisa Simpson: You voted for Reagan?!
Marge Simpson: It was a crazy time, the eighties.
Marge Simpson: You don't hear me listening to the Thompson Twins anymore. Although...
Lisa Simpson: So... you were going through a phase?
Homer Simpson: All right, eighties party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall! Because I think the beef is behind that wall!
Homer Simpson: Now get up here, boy! We're gonna do the Super Bowl Shuffle.

Isabel Gutierrez: No, it's okay. My Mom says you're just going through a liberal phase.
Lisa Simpson: What?! My Mom says you're going through a conservative phase!
Isabel Gutierrez: There's no such thing. Conservatives only get more conservative! Because every year they get a little further through "Atlas Shrugged."

Ralph Wiggum: Just call me Ralph Nader! I don't know why.
Lisa Simpson: Isabel! I want this campaign to be about the issues: same-sex fieldtrip buddies, providing class pets with a path to citizenship...
Nelson Muntz: And no digging up past relationships. Sure, Lisa and I dated. Sure, she broke my heart. I'm sure your researchers know all about it.
Nelson Muntz: (HURT) Really? But I got this!

Isabel Gutierrez: I'd rather do this myself.
C. Montgomery Burns: (THUNDERING) But who'd own you then?!
Isabel Gutierrez: You couldn't buy me with a wheelbarrow full of ice cream!
Dracula: (SARCASTIC) Whoa, nicely done. You've charmed another one right into the arms of the Libertarian Party.
Rainier Wolfcastle: Maybe we can help her without her knowing we're helping her.
C. Montgomery Burns: No one says I can't buy a second grade election. Why, I had enough money to fix People Magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive."
C. Montgomery Burns: Most of the money went to convincing them that I was "alive."
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: Who ordered the Yumboni?
C. Montgomery Burns: Right here! Now, Smithers. I want you to eat this for me, describe every taste, and don't forget the brain freeze!

Pigsty: Grooming? Yuck!
Isabel Gutierrez: Unfortunately, I can't stop it. The Supreme Court says spending money is free speech.
Lisa Simpson: Well then you could use your free speech to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election.
Isabel Gutierrez: I'll think about it while I'm on my listening tour of the cafeteria.

Milhouse Van Houten: (GASPS) Not Pizza Friday! Sorry Lisa, you lose again.
Bart Simpson: You gotta get on your game, sister. You think I'm tough? Wait till Gutierrez sinks her teeth into you.
Bart Simpson: Remember you've got an ace in the hole -- chocolate milk in the water fountains.

2nd First Grader: And I say we move beyond name-calling to solve our real problems.
Kids: Boo!

Isabel Gutierrez: (READING OFF A LIST) Ivy Agee, Frank Marino, Glen Gloyd. These are men who fought at Omaha Beach, and they are the reason I'm running for Second Grade Rep. (HUSHED) Dios los bendiga a todos.
Gary Chalmers: (TURNS TO SKINNER) I'll bet my baloney sandwich that girl's gonna win.
Seymour Skinner: A little rich for my blood, sir.
Gary Chalmers: Yes, you can fog a mirror, Seymour, but I wouldn't call you alive. (TO CROWD) Now, the other candidate, Lisa Simpson.
Lisa Simpson: Okay, I'm a liberal. And sometimes that's a dirty word.
DOLPH: (TO SELF) Liberal. (LAUGHS)
Lisa Simpson: But what liberal really means, is someone who believes that those who have more than enough should share a little with those who don't.
Lisa Simpson: And those principles have consistently been in place during this country's most prosperous times. So if that's a liberal then I am a liberal... and hang me.
Lisa Simpson: (TERRIFIED NOISE)
Dewey Largo: Sorry, we're just setting up for "An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge."

Walter Mondale: I'm afraid you're heading for a loss, Lisa. And when we lose, we lose big!
Lisa Simpson: What about Obama? Harry Truman? Bill Clinton?
Bill Clinton: Lisa, you're a lot like me: play the saxophone, come from a small town, raised by a mother with no help.
Lisa Simpson: So, do you know how I can win?
Bill Clinton: I don't even know why I'm a ghost. All these guys are alive. John Kerry here is Secretary of State. And doin' a bang-up job.
John Kerry: Well, we still have a long way to go on Asian currency issues.
Waylon Smithers: Can I at least remove the balloons?
Bill Clinton: Absolutely. And Lisa, I'm only appearing in this dream so I can visit with you about the Clinton Global Initiative. See, our mission is to turn ideas into action and to find innovative solutions to... hey, hey, hey, hey, you can't fall asleep in a dream!

Bart Simpson: I wanna see "Radioactive Man Re-Rises!"
Lisa Simpson: If Bart's going, I'm going!
Homer Simpson: If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter!
Marge Simpson: We'll call that nice girl who's getting her Masters in Child Development.

Squeaky-Voiced Teen: For the 3-D show, that'll be seventy-two dollars.
Homer Simpson: More snip, less lip.
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: Homer looks upset at the high ticket prices.
Squeaky-Voiced Teen: Or, for ten dollars more you can see it in IMAX Hobbit Frame Rate Virtual Reality Vision.
Homer Simpson: All right, movie, you better be worth it.
Homer Simpson: The motorcycle dudes are chicks!
Homer Simpson: I wonder what else is chicks?
Radioactive Man: (SLOGAN) Don't ask. Do smell.
Announcer: Also available in "Arctic Slut," "Morning After Melon," and "Elon Musk."
Homer Simpson: Hey... they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!
Homer Simpson: (INCREDULOUS) You're shushing me! This guy's on his cell phone! She's texting! He's sexting! And that guy brought a baby to a nine o'clock movie!
Raiders Dad: (LATINO) That's negative, man.
Homer Simpson: What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this!

(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - night)
Bart Simpson: Chins up, Homer. You don't need a theater to watch the movie. (SNEAKY) You just have to illegally download it.
Homer Simpson: Illegally download it? Is that legal?
Bart Simpson: Who knows? But it sure is easy. I'll walk you through it. All you have to do is--
Serious Announcer: (QUICKLY) The FOX network forbids the broadcast of step-by-step instructions for illegally downloading copyrighted intellectual property. In the meantime, please enjoy this footage from Nascar's 2011 Martinsville Cup.
Homer Simpson: Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--

Bart Simpson: I'm under thirty.

Carl Carlson: (CUTTING HIM OFF) Uh, Homer, that movie's been talked out. We're discussing the new James Bond flick.
Lenny Leonard: I like that James Bond is ugly now.
Carl Carlson: I like that he doesn't have any gadgets.
Lenny Leonard: I like that he's not good at shooting, doesn't say funny quips, or do any James Bond stuff.
Homer Simpson: Shut up shut up shut up!
Carl Carlson: Homer, go to the theater and see the movie.
Homer Simpson: (CONTEMPTUOUS) Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. Care to join me?
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - TV ROOM - afternoon)
Lenny Leonard: That was so much better than the cinema. It mixes the wonder of movie-going with the rush of stealing.
Carl Carlson: All we want is brand new, big budget entertainment in our homes for nothin'! Why doesn't Hollywood get that?
Homer Simpson: Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!
Carl Carlson: Yeah, no more jerks talking on their cell phones!
Lenny Leonard: No more jerks telling me not to talk on my cell phone!
Homer Simpson: And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!
Homer Simpson: Welcome to "Cinema Pirate-diso." Tonight's movie is "Life is Funny," directed by Judd Apatow. It's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!
Paul Rudd: Did you just pass gas while we were making love?
Leslie Mann: You're the one who hired the Korean taco truck for our private school fundraiser!

Ned Flanders: We may be going to hell for seeing "side bosom," but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!
Audience: (CHEERS)
Marge Simpson: This is fun! And it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.
Homer Simpson: Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... (SUAVELY) illegally.
Marge Simpson: An illegal download? But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.
Homer Simpson: (SCOFFS) Why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world?
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Marge Simpson: When I watched that pirated movie, I was stealing with my eyes. So I'm repaying the good people in Hollywood for the ticket I should have bought.
Marge Simpson: Now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.

Young Fbi Agent: Sir, you have to see this.

Lisa Simpson: (DISBELIEF) You like this?
Deputy Director Gratman: We got our man, thanks to a tip from a heroic American snitch.
Homer Simpson: One of you turned me in? Who was it?

Lisa Simpson: It's almost like having Dad here. Only with less growling when I go near his food.
Bart Simpson: I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad. Lousy rat.
Marge Simpson: Maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.
Bart Simpson: Homer just pirated a movie. It's not the worst thing Dad ever did. It's not even the worst kind of pirate Dad's ever been.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what.
Lisa Simpson: I don't know. It wasn't like Dad was stealing for himself. He created this wonderful experience for the whole town. I just can't imagine anyone turning him in.
Lisa Simpson: Dad! Dad! You're back! You're back! (ETC.)
Marge Simpson: Homer! What are you doing out of prison? You have to go back and give yourself up.
Homer Simpson: I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!
Lisa Simpson: Wait, I know one place in Springfield that doesn't care about internet piracy laws.
(SWEDISH CONSULATE: ext. swedish consulate - day)

Gottfrid: (CHUCKLES) This consulate is like being on Swedish soil. You're as safe here as you would be in the Skatteskrapan.
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED WHISTLE)
Marge Simpson: Your country doesn't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong.
Lisa Simpson: (TO MARGE) The people of Sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.
Marge Simpson: How is that not stealing?
Gottfrid: Bah! Your Hollywood studios are the real thieves -- claiming all their hit movies have lost money. I spit on their bookkeeping!
Homer Simpson: Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to "Taken" where the "Hangover" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is "Fast and Furious."
Bart Simpson: Oh man, I would love to pirate that.
Gottfrid: (SAGELY) As would the proud people of Sweden.
Lisa Simpson: They've found us!
Deputy Director Gratman: There's only one surefire way to get fugitives out of a foreign building: blasting death metal.
Death Metal Lead Singer: (A LA "BREAKING THE LAW") RESPECTIN' THE LAW / RESPECTIN' THE LAW / COPYRIGHT LAW / COPYRIGHT LAW
Gottfrid: (CHUCKLES) Swedes love death metal. It reminds us of death.
Deputy Director Gratman: Damn those peace prize-giving fish-smokers!
Marge Simpson: I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.
Homer Simpson: (SWEETLY) Consulate.
Homer Simpson: (HELPFUL) Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital.
Homer Simpson: Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. You're the greatest wife in the world.
Marge Simpson: It was me! I was the one who told the FBI.
Homer Simpson: You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!
Marge Simpson: I was just trying to do the right thing! Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
Homer Simpson: Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?
Marge Simpson: I never wanted to say funny vows!
Homer Simpson: Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.
Marge Simpson: I didn't mean for this to happen, but... (SMALL) you were stealing.

Blue-Haired Lawyer: The people call Hollywood ultra-producer, Judd Apatow.
Judd Apatow: Homer Simpson is an enemy of art. Art created by writers, directors, and the guy who uses a computer to erase or enhance nipples.
Judd Apatow: And not just the people who dream for a living, but the people who depend on us. The spin class instructors, the personal rabbis, Seth Rogen.
SETH ROGEN: (STONER LAUGH CRYING, THEN) It's true, I need him.
Judd Apatow: (TEARING UP) I saw a bootleg DVD of "The 40 Year Old Virgin" for sale at a carwash... they left off my director's commentary! It didn't even have a blooper reel!

Homer Simpson: (POUTY) No.
Marge Simpson: Homer, tell them your side of the story. I know I hurt you, but please trust me now. It'll work.
Homer Simpson: You know what, Judge Apatow... I do have something to say. These movie people may say I'm a pirate. But I'm just a man. A man who loved Hollywood too much. So I made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life.
Producer #1: He doesn't sound like a villain.
Producer #2: He sounds like a classic underdog.
Producer #3: He's the unlikeliest of heroes!
Producer #4: But where's the love story?
Homer Simpson: At first my wife didn't believe in me. Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
Homer Simpson: But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in.
Producer #2: He's a downloading David versus a greedy Goliath!
Producer #1: An Erin Brockovich -- but with more cleavage!
Producer #3: (CHECKING MYPAD) Two, three, good lord.
Producer #3: He's hitting all four quadrants!
Homer Simpson: One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost.
Producer #1: Mr. Simpson, I'd like to buy the rights to make a movie based on your true story.
Judd Apatow: I'm attached as executive producer! Attached! Attached!
Producer #3: One movie? We envision a trilogy.
Producer #4: (ON PHONE) Will Smith's family wants to play your family.
Bart Simpson: I'd be Jaden!
Producers: (CLAMORING NOISES)
Judd Apatow: On behalf of Hollywood, we are dropping all charges.
Lisa Simpson: These people hate my dad. How can they want to make a movie about him?
Deputy Director Gratman: Hollywood may be run by big corporations trying to squash people, but they make movies about people standing up to big corporations trying to squash them... and winning.
Lisa Simpson: And the worst one of all is--
Homer Simpson: I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.

Homer Simpson: The hell you are! Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths.
Springfielders: (SHOCKED NOISE)
Comic Book Guy: But the movie is, it's about you pirating movies.

Strawberry: Now when Milo talks to himself it won't seem crazy.
Comic Book Guy: So, Milo talks to himself. We will treasure that information. Yes we will.
Milo: Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride. Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp if you have no one to read it with, right?

Bart Simpson: (SCOFFS) Well, no way I'm giving a valentine to Nelson. He's a bully, and I do not love him.

Will Lyman: Human young are born with the ability to count valentines, and Danny realizes he's been snubbed.
Anonymous Expert: (DISTORTED VOICE) Past generations of children were used to rejection. But today's kids, raised in a climate of video games and instant messaging, are fragile weirdoes.
Will Lyman: On February fifteenth, two a.m., after checking the mailbox one last time, Danny nearly died from an overdose of little candy hearts.
Will Lyman: Many of history's monsters never received a valentine: Attila the Hun. Mao Tse Tung. And me, Will Lyman. This is Firstline.

Jimbo Jones: All right, Simpson. Twenty big ones says you're not messed-up enough to eat... this!
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) No Bart, no. Do it and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog.
Frog: Where's my money! Get my money! Money-money-money-money-money...
Bart Simpson: Easiest money I ever...
(Hospital: int. hospital - day)
Diggs: I like the lack of attention. Especially in here.
(Falconry Clubhouse: INT. FALCONRY CLUBHOUSE - DAY)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Son, by rights I should be playing banjo at your funeral. That frog was filled to the gills with formaldehyde, a highly toxic poison. (CHUCKLES)
Bart Simpson: (FEEBLY) Here's your money, dad.
Homer Simpson: (GENUINELY FORGOT) What? Did you owe me some money?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: And Homer, here's your bill for four thousand dollars.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Where's my money? You got my money? Where's my money? (CHUCKLES) Seriously, where's my money?

Girl: Ew! It's the kid who ate the dead frog.
Nelson Muntz: Herbivore!
Lisa Simpson: That's someone who eats plants.
Nelson Muntz: I named the frog Herb!
Bart Simpson: Even you won't sit with me?
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, if you sit here, I'll be the boy who sat next to the boy who ate the frog. And I'm already the boy who shared a comb with a boy who threw up on the boy who wet his pants at the winter carnival. P.S. I would've given you the money.
Bart Simpson: (AGGRAVATED NOISE)
(Springfield Elementary School: ext. springfield elementary - day)
Jimbo Jones: What's the matter? Frog in your throat?
Bart Simpson: You're the ones that paid me to eat it.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: All we hear is ribbit, ribbit!
DOLPH: (SCARED NOISE) You said this was a simple bullying job!
Diggs: (SLIGHT UPPER-CLASS ACCENT) Diggs and Freedom, at your service. (GESTURES TO SELF) Diggs is short for Digby.
Bart Simpson: Thanks. (LOWERS HEAD) I'm the kid that ate the frog.
Diggs: Oh, so you're the reason I had to dissect a Muppet in biology today.
Bart Simpson: Thanks for the help, man.
Diggs: Oh, you're welcome. At least, from me. There's no way to say what the bird thinks, or even if he thinks, really.
Bart Simpson: Wait! Wait! Wait! Who the hell are you?
Diggs: (SHRUGS) I transferred here a few months ago.
Bart Simpson: To this school? On purpose? Even after Springfield Montessori opened across the street?
Bart Simpson: That place is really in your face.
Cats: (LOUDER DROWNING, VOMITING NOISES)
Bart Simpson: This school has a falconry club? No way.
Diggs: I resuscitated it.
Diggs: I'm president, secretary-treasurer, and faculty adviser. That took a lot of fancy paperwork but it was worth it to be left alone.
Bart Simpson: Can I join?
Diggs: Hmm, I'll have to check with Freedom.
Diggs: Habemus Papam! We have a poop! (LOOKS DOWN) It's white! You're in!
(Springfield Elementary School: EXT. Springfield elementary - after school - DAY)
Groundskeeper Willie: Looks like the falconry club's back from the dead!
Seymour Skinner: Can the Esperanto Society be far behind? I mean... Ĉu la Esperanto-Societo esti multe malantaŭ?
Groundskeeper Willie: Two languages and somehow no one will talk to you.
Seymour Skinner: (VERY SAD) Ĝi estas vera. Mi tre soleca.
Diggs: The first thing to learn about falcons is how beautiful they are in flight.
Diggs: Don't fret, he'll be back.
Ralph Wiggum: There's my Sky Gramma!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - simultaneous)
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED MURMUR) Bart's usually first in line for Taco night, but now he's "muy tarde." (CONCERNED NOISE) Is it all right to say "tarde?"
Homer Simpson: Hey, you've said it twice, Marge. You're in pretty deep.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Ten minute rule.
Marge Simpson: Lisa!
Lisa Simpson: (SHRUGS, MOUTH FULL) What? A rule's a rule.
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. school - early evening)
Diggs: (POINTS, EXCITED) There he is!
Diggs: He is just riding that thermal.
Bart Simpson: You were right about watching him fly.
Diggs: (NODS) I thought you'd get it. Seat-backs and tray tables, Bart. We're coming in for a landing!
Bart Simpson: Wow. You don't know how impressive that is to a boy whose dad can't even get the dog to sit.
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - a little later)
Homer Simpson: (GROWING ANGER) Sit. Sit. Sit! Sit! SIT!!!
Homer Simpson: (FURIOUS) I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!
Marge Simpson: Where could Bart be?
Diggs: (JAUNTY) Hey, I'm not flying anywhere with this broken wing.
Lisa Simpson: I saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.
Homer Simpson: Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler.
Bart Simpson: Bart Simpson, at your service.
Homer Simpson: More like "at your six-pack," am I right? (CHUCKLES) It's okay if you need to take a little nap.
Bart Simpson: Why would I want a nap?
Homer Simpson: (GETTING IRRITATED) Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
Bart Simpson: I wasn't drinking. I was learning that nature isn't a complete waste of space.
Lisa Simpson: That doesn't sound like you.
Homer Simpson: But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
Bart Simpson: I met this kid. A little older, kind of strange. I don't think other people get him, but I just wanna hang out with him all the time.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey. (CHUCKLES)
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED) What's he doing?
(SKIES OVER SPRINGFIELD: ext. skies over Springfield)
(Woods: EXT. WOODS - DAY)
Diggs: Now when he lands, you'll feed him, so he has positive associations with you.
Diggs: Don't worry. He's only bitten off one of my fingers.
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Diggs: Just goofing on you. This is the finger he bit off.
Diggs: If he starts to carry you off, slip out of the glove. Now tell him to fly.
Bart Simpson: Fly! Fly! C'mon, man! Do the wing thing!
Bart Simpson: I did it! He did it! We did it!
Diggs: Yes, Bart, that is how you conjugate the verb "to do." (SMILES) Well done.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Disco Stu: Hey! Bring back my bling!
Krusty the Clown: Give that back! All I've got is a hole in my face!
Krusty the Clown: (NASAL) Uncle Krusty's back!
(TREETOP: EXT. TREETOP - A LITTLE LATER)
Bart Simpson: Whoa! Did you teach him to do that?
Bart Simpson: I get it. It sucks. Really sucks.
Diggs: (LAUGHS) Nobody could communicate that -- except maybe Gerard Manley Hopkins:
Diggs: (QUOTING) "I caught this morning morning's minion, kingdom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding / Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding / High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing!"
Bart Simpson: Wow.
Bart Simpson: I've already eaten.
Diggs: (GETS AN IDEA) Hey, you want to see something really cool?
Bart Simpson: (ATTITUDE: "ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?") Is a falcon's training leash called a creance? Yes!
Bart Simpson: Say something so I'll know you're not hurt.
Diggs: (FAR BELOW) I'm really hurt.
Bart Simpson: Phew!
(Springfield General Hospital: ext. springfield hospital - establishing)

Bart Simpson: Well... my Dad said don't bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY)
Homer Simpson: Okay. In your terms, points are like mice.
FREEDOM: (FALCON SCREECH)
Homer Simpson: Don't interrupt! I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.
FREEDOM: (FALCON SCREECH)
Grampa Simpson: You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.
Homer Simpson: (HURT) Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
Homer Simpson: Look, the Eagles and the Falcons. Tell me you're not interested in that.
Homer Simpson: (EXASPERATED NOISE) I could fly too if I didn't have a wife and three kids!
(Hospital Room: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS)
Bart Simpson: Hey, you've had a lot of visitors.
Diggs: (PLEASANT) No, I signed them myself. They're people I would've liked to come visit.
Bart Simpson: Listen... what happened in that tree?
Diggs: Um... you want the truth? Of course you do. You're like Diogenes, but with slingshot in place of lamp.
Diggs: I wanted to fly.
Diggs: I know it sounds a little crazy now, but I suddenly thought maybe we can all fly, but somehow we've forgotten that we can.
Bart Simpson: You don't still think that, do you?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Bart, here's another doctor that would like a few words with this young man.
Bart Simpson: (STUNNED) This hospital has another doctor?
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - EVENING)
Bart Simpson: So they're transferring him to another hospital.
Marge Simpson: Well, I hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back. I don't care for how it circles the cat.
Bart Simpson: He's just riding the thermals from Dad's butt.
Homer Simpson: At least someone in this family is using them.
Bart Simpson: I never heard of this new hospital so I looked it up and printed it out.
Marge Simpson: (SURPRISED MURMUR)
Bart Simpson: Can I visit him tomorrow?
Marge Simpson: I don't know Bart. This is one of those... Arkham Asylum-type hospitals.
Bart Simpson: Diggs isn't cuckoo!
Homer Simpson: Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler.
Bart Simpson: Milhouse abandoned me.
Bart Simpson: So, why can't I go there?
Marge Simpson: Bart, if this is what I think it is, it's not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy.
Bart Simpson: Then why is Diggs there?
Homer Simpson: Because it's his home forever.
(Bart's Bedroom: Int. Bart's room - night)
Lisa Simpson: You know, Bart, just because Diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person.
Bart Simpson: What would you know about friends like Diggs?
Lisa Simpson: I have about eight of them.
Bart Simpson: So how do we fix him?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Bart... Diggs' problems don't have easy fixes.
Bart Simpson: What kind of cheer-up talk is this?
Lisa Simpson: Well... sometimes it helps to know people feel for you. Want a hug?
Bart Simpson: You hug the bedpost. Then I hug the bedpost. That way we never hug each other.
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. Springfield elementary - falconry hutch - day)
Jimbo Jones: Hey, Simpson. I heard bird boy got a new cage -- one with rubber bars.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Yeah, and a rubber perch!
DOLPH: Yeah, yeah, and a...
DOLPH: (FEEBLY) ...rubber birdfeeder.
Jimbo Jones: Making fun of the mentally ill. Real classy.
DOLPH: But you guys were...
Kearney Zzyzwicz: We were what, Captain Sensitive?
(FALCONRY CLUB: Int. Falconry club - continuous)
Diggs: The rumors of my bonkertude have been greatly exaggerated. D.S.M. Five indicates paranoid schizophrenia. But that work is mired in controversy. Mired.
Bart Simpson: I knew you'd escape! Were you carried out by a flock of falcons?
Diggs: I got a one-day pass.
Bart Simpson: Were falcons involved in any way?
Diggs: I obtained the pass to enter the Springfield Falconry Contest, which is what Freedom and I were training for when we first met you.
Bart Simpson: Great. Before anything else, let me just get closer to the door and say "how crazy are you"?
Diggs: I'm fine. My meds won't wear off till tonight. (OMINOUS) Then I'll have Freedom tear you to shreds.
Bart Simpson: No offense, but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy, it's not funny.
Diggs: You're discounting all talk radio.

Comic Book Guy: Fly my pet! Fly! Yes! Yes, now back to papa! Yes.
Bart Simpson: Why am I not surprised the only sport you do is one where a bird brings you food?
Comic Book Guy: A falcon's greatest joy is to serve its master.
Comic Book Guy's Bird: (PARROT VOICE) Fatso!
Comic Book Guy: Once again I must point out you are not a parrot.
Comic Book Guy's Bird: (PARROT VOICE) Fatso! Fatso! Pees in the shower! (WHISTLES)
Comic Book Guy: Shut up!
Bart Simpson: What are you doing?
Diggs: We're up next. When Freedom hits the air, you and I open all the cages.
Bart Simpson: (DUBIOUS) Um... with our minds?
Diggs: No! With this rope! (HOLDS UP CORD) I'm a messed-up kid, I'm not Magneto.
Announcer: Diggs and Freedom!
Diggs: (QUOTING EXCITEDLY) "In his ecstasy! Then off, off forth on swing!"
C. Montgomery Burns: Where's my bird going?!
Diggs: Wherever he wants. He's free now.
Cletus Spuckler: If you see the stork what brings us babies, kill it!
Diggs: (SIGHS) Now Bart, I'm afraid one-day passes don't last forever. And I'm probably not going to get another one for quite a while.
Bart Simpson: Wait. When will I see you? (IMPLORING) You can't quit the falconry club!
Diggs: It's all yours, Mr. President.
Bart Simpson: Well, I guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage.
Diggs: I had thought of it as a therapeutic milieu, but now "cage" is stuck in my head, so thanks. (BEAT) And thanks for being my friend.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, when I pushed you away, I was really pushing away the thought of losing you.
Bart Simpson: How long did it take you to think that up?
Milhouse Van Houten: Two hours with the therapist.
Bart Simpson: I'll take that.
Milhouse Van Houten: She came in on a Saturday. Missed her kid's karate demonstration. He was goin' up a belt.
Bart Simpson: Enough!
Bart Simpson: Mom, you didn't cook the falcon?!
Marge Simpson: Of course not. It's just duck.

Sideshow Mel: Hear-hear!
Alarmist Narrator: If there's one thing scientists love it's money. Money, money, money! And that's been true of scientists ever since caveman times.
Alarmist Narrator: We need look no further back than the ancient Mayans, who cross-bred plants and animals in an unholy experiment in what is now a resort that charges thirty dollars a night to valet park.
Alarmist Narrator: Once you're there, they've gotcha.
Crowd: (GASP)
Alarmist Narrator: The Mayans didn't listen... to themselves.
Alarmist Narrator: Yet, today, we toy with our fate by using retroviruses to create these so-called "super foods". Are we doomed to repeat an event that destroyed all human life? The answer is in your mouth.
Lisa Simpson: Um... that video seemed a little... unscientific.
"Jenny McCarthy": My name is Jenny McCarthy, and I endorse this tirade.

Lisa Simpson: And I refuse to concede a mind that thinks so much like mine can be all bad. Mom?

Bart Simpson: Absolutely. We're talking about Lisa, right?
Lisa Simpson: Shut up!
Bart Simpson: You shut up!

Lisa Simpson: Bob! You saved me! (PUZZLED) But how did you get the strength? Calder's work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy.
Sideshow Bob: Well put.
Lisa Simpson: Thank you. (LAUGHS) Answer the question.
Lisa Simpson: Well... there is something I should have told you. You see, it occurred to me that if I can genetically modify fruits and vegetables, why can't I modify... me!
Lisa Simpson: You've been changing your DNA?!
Sideshow Bob: At first, just a peptide here and there. Carrot for my presbyopia, brahma bull for strength... And a touch of corn for highlights on my hair.
Lisa Simpson: So... how strong are you?
Hans Moleman: Figurines! Get your porcelain figurines!
Sideshow Bob: (OVERLY FRIENDLY) Now how 'bout those impressionists?
Lisa Simpson: But... but we sang Gershwin together!
Sideshow Bob: Well rhapsody in boo-hoo. Do you know why we came to the museum today?
Lisa Simpson: (STARTING TO CRY) Well, I thought it was because it was Tote Bag day.
Sideshow Bob: Well that was part of it!
Sideshow Bob: But the biggest part was that!
Sideshow Bob: Washington's backbone... Einstein's eyebrows... Florence Nightingale's tenacity, though I'll have to clip around her moral fiber.
Lisa Simpson: You're going to take DNA from these historical figures and add it to your own?
Sideshow Bob: I shall be the wisest and strongest maniac ever to bring the blessings of dictatorship to the world!
Bart Simpson: Jig's up, Bob!
Bart Simpson: (GRIM) Return the spear to the homo erectus. (HUGE LAUGH) Homo erectus? Where has that word been all my life? (LAUGHS)
Sideshow Bob: Now Bart, I promised I wouldn't hurt you.
Bart Simpson: You did that for me?
Lisa Simpson: More for mom, but yes.
Sideshow Bob: But beware, I have DNA in me from Ophiocordyceps Unilateralis, better known as (BOOMING) "zombie ant fungus"!
Bart Simpson: (CONFUSED) And we're scared of that because...?
Sideshow Bob: (TIGHTLY WOUND) What I am saying is I could be tipped into a murderous rage by the slightest provocation.

Sideshow Bob: (STOPS) Ahh, you know Mozart?

Lisa Simpson: I hear chewing!
Bart Simpson: No, that's a much bigger animal.
Homer Simpson: Kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.
Lisa Simpson: I've lost my guinea pig!
Lisa Simpson: Pokey!
Marge Simpson: (MOANS) That's okay sweetheart. Your pig thingy didn't mean it. It's just... it felt comforting to know that while we watched TV, there was art going on behind us.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Well, I guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting.
Homer Simpson: Sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. Or...
(VAN HOUTENS' YARD: ext. van houtens' yard - establishing shot)
Kirk Van Houten: Milhouse played the violin for years until it turned out the vibrations were screwing up his bones.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, these seem great. (SNIFFS IT) Oh, too bad someone used cello rosin.
Marge Simpson: Oh my gosh, that's beautiful! I've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before.
Luann Van Houten: (DISMISSIVE) Oh that, that was on the wall of Kirk's bachelor pad, back when we were (WHISPERS) separated.
Kirk Van Houten: Yeah, it's a great piece. I didn't have a mirror so I shaved in the reflection of the chrome frame.
Marge Simpson: This could be our new living room painting!
Homer Simpson: I don't know. How 'bout this poster of a really rockin' jukebox?
Homer Simpson: You know it's rockin' 'cause music notes are coming out of it.
Kirk Van Houten: Painting's only twenty bucks.
Marge Simpson: Oh please, Homie...
Kirk Van Houten: (SELLING) I'll throw in the tiny violins...
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - living room - that night)
Marge Simpson: Oh, it looks great!
Homer Simpson: Well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks.
Marge Simpson: I've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from Kirk's bachelor bad. I hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, look... there's a signature that the frame covered up: (READING) "Johan Oldenveldt."
Lisa Simpson: Here he is! (READING) "Johan Oldenveldt, painter, lived in Amsterdam, Paris... prolific early 20th century naturalist... I think this was painted by someone famous. Maybe it's valuable.
Marge Simpson: We should have it appraised!
Homer Simpson: (SCOFFS) You guys are crazy. I've never even heard of that guy. It's not like it was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci Code.
Homer Simpson: Now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. Nudity. 2. Holograms. 3. Something terrible happening to Jesus.
(Art Auction House: Ext. ART AUCTION HOUSE - day)
(Springfield Art Auction House: INT. SPRINGFIELD ART AUCTION HOUSE - DAY)
Duncan: (ENGLISH ACCENT) Ah yes, seascape... marvelous natural light... classic use of (OVER-PRONOUNCING) gouache... (CONSIDERING) You're right. This is an early-career Oldenveldt. Quite valuable.
Marge Simpson: Oh my God!
Duncan: I expect it to go somewhere between eighty to one hundred thousand dollars.
Homer Simpson: (SMALL GASP) Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it!
Bart Simpson: But I want to see it!
Homer Simpson: No, you'll wear it out!
Homer Simpson: Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.
Marge Simpson: Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth. Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them.
Homer Simpson: Split it? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

Homer Simpson: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?
Marge Simpson: Kirk and Luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.
Homer Simpson: Yes, they sold it to us. So now it's our painting. We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep.
Bart Simpson: For ourselves?
Homer Simpson: This dude gets it.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Marge Simpson: But the Van Houtens are our friends!
Homer Simpson: I don't know what you're talking about. (CALLING INSIDE, LOUD WHISPER) Hide the treasure!
Homer Simpson: Are they, Marge? If you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?
Marge Simpson: All our friends are like that!
(Evergreen Terrace: ext. evergreen terrace - day)
Marge Simpson: Well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?
Homer Simpson: I would feel: A). Happy for their good fortune, B). Proud to know rich people, and C). Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake.
("PAY & LEAVE" SUPERMARKET: int. "PAY & LEAVE" supermarket - day)
Marge Simpson: How about this... what if we give the Van Houtens twenty-five percent of the money?
Homer Simpson: Then they'll just be mad about the sixty-five percent that we're keeping!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - backyard - day)
Homer Simpson: Marge, you like kindness, right?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: So even if we gave Kirk and Luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti.
Homer Simpson: Homer looks into Marge's eyes.
Homer Simpson: (THOUGHTFUL) It's kinder never to tell them.
Marge Simpson: Okay... I see your point. We should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the Van Houtens.
Homer Simpson: What'll it take to buy your silence?
(Toy Store: EXT. TOY STORE - LATER - ESTABLISHING)
Homer Simpson: Okay Milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together.
Milhouse Van Houten: And all I have to do is not say anything about some painting to my Mom and Dad?
Marge Simpson: Oh sweetie, you want your parents to be happy, don't you?
Milhouse Van Houten: I guess.
Homer Simpson: "I guess." (FAKE LAUGH) You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you.
Milhouse Van Houten: She is?
Lisa Simpson: She is?
Milhouse Van Houten: ...so if I keep my mouth shut, you get me new wheelie sneakers, and Bart agrees to promote and encourage use of my new cool nickname, "C.J."...
Bart Simpson: You got it, Ceej.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - living room - the next day)
Kirk Van Houten: You found out that painting was worth big bucks, and you weren't gonna tell us?!
Homer Simpson: We had a deal. (WHISPERED FURY) And now we've got nothing...
Luann Van Houten: We considered you our friends... we trusted you... I let Homer use our master bathroom! Then you stab us in the back!
Marge Simpson: (SHEEPISH) If you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing, how could you live with yourselves? We were just trying to be... kind.
Kirk Van Houten: Kind!? You call it kind to give us nothing?
Homer Simpson: We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!
Kirk Van Houten: Oh, so that's how it is!
Homer Simpson: That's exactly how it is.
Kirk Van Houten: Oh is it?
Homer Simpson: Oh it is.
Marge Simpson: Luann, I hope we're still on Thursday for collecting used cellphones for the troops.
Luann Van Houten: I don't think you need any help. You're so good at... collecting.
Marge Simpson: (SHOCKED/ANGRY NOISE)
Homer Simpson: (CALLING AFTER THEM) Oh, that was cold, Luann. So cold! (SARCASTIC SHIVERS) BRRRRR! SARCASTIC BRRRRRR!
Marge Simpson: See what happens when we get greedy?
Homer Simpson: (SERIOUS) Honey, there's something I wanna show you.
Marge Simpson: An ATM receipt?
Homer Simpson: I don't know whose this is. I found it next to the cash machine, and I've always kept it. Look at the balance.
Marge Simpson: (RE: RECEIPT) Five figures!
Homer Simpson: With that painting we could have what these people have. (HOLDS UP RECEIPT) A money cushion. No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter.
Marge Simpson: I could write a check with... today's date on it.
Homer Simpson: (NODDING) That's the cushion.
(Simpson Home: int. simpsons house - tv room - continuous)
Kirk Van Houten: Oh, definitely betrayal, Kent.
Kent Brockman: Interesting.
Kent Brockman: So if you see the Simpsons walking down your street, lock your doors and hide... your friendship.
Marge Simpson: Great! Now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!
Homer Simpson: Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.
Marge Simpson: (READING) "Give back the painting!" The whole town's turned against us!
Homer Simpson: (READING) "You have no obligation to share the money from that painting." Ooo, a support rock!
Bart Simpson: This one's against us. This one's for us. For, for, against, for, against...
Marge Simpson: (CONCERNED) We don't even get this many Christmas cards.
(Springfield Street: EXT. springfield street - morning)
Sideshow Mel: There they are, the Masterpiece Thievers!

Homer Simpson: Just close your eyes and think of the cushion.
(AUCTION FLOOR: int. auction floor - a little later)
Duncan: First lot: "Untitled Landscape" by Johan Oldenveldt, from the Collection of Homer J. and Marge B. Simpson. Let's open the bidding at eighty thousand dollars.
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) The paddles, Marge! Look at the paddles!
Woman's Voice: Stop the auction!
Woman's Voice: That painting belongs to me!
Kirk Van Houten: (HORRIFIED) Dawn?
DAWN: Good to see you again, Beef Kirky.
Luann Van Houten: (TO KIRK) Who is this woman?
Kirk Van Houten: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
DAWN: While you two were separated, Kirk and I used to be friends... with (SEXY) banana-fits.
Luann Van Houten: You told me you didn't see anyone during our separation.
Kirk Van Houten: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
Duncan: Madam, are you saying this painting belongs to you?
DAWN: Kirk stole it from me! But I didn't know it was valuable until I saw the story on TV.
Kirk Van Houten: What? I bought that painting! She's lying!
Duncan: (BANGS GAVEL) The auction is on hold until we can determine the true ownership.
Homer Simpson: Our cushion!
Luann Van Houten: Don't bother coming home, Kirk!
Kirk Van Houten: (AGONIZED MOAN)
Marge Simpson: See what your greed has done?
Homer Simpson: Excuse me, we're trying to find "Café Artiste."
DAWN: (TO AUDIENCE) Anybody want to give me a ride home? Going once? Going twice?
Duncan: Sold! To the lonely auctioneer!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day - establishing)
Kirk Van Houten: Thanks for taking me in, man...
Homer Simpson: I guess I can't help but feel fully responsible.
Kirk Van Houten: Oh Luann... I'll never gaze from my thick eyeglasses into your thick eyeglasses ever again.
Homer Simpson: What you need, my friend, is a Canadian Duff. Beauty, eh?
Homer Simpson: So, why does that chick think she owns the painting?
Kirk Van Houten: (MOROSE) Dawn and I went on a vacation to a resort island called Isla Verde. I bought the painting in a café... but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor.
Homer Simpson: Not your fault, man. Those parasailing guys take whatever they want.
Kirk Van Houten: It was never her painting. That woman will say anything to keep herself in electric cigarettes. And I'd go back to that Café Artiste to prove it... but nothing's gonna get me Luann back.
(KITCHEN: int. kitchen - moments later)
Homer Simpson: Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find Café Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story. That will prove the painting was his -- and now ours.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed Kirk and Luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about Milhouse.
Bart Simpson: He's been playing Dancing Revolution for hours, but the TV is off.
Homer Simpson: (PLAINTIVE) But our cushion...
Marge Simpson: That picture has brought out the worst in everyone! Please... just let it go!
Bart Simpson: You're not gonna let it go, are you?
Homer Simpson: I wish I knew how.
(Harbor: ext. HARBOR - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: This is so exciting! My first time establishing provenance!
Homer Simpson: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just remember, if your mother asks, I took you to a wine tasting.
Lisa Simpson: That's a terrible thing for a father to do.
Homer Simpson: That's why she'll believe it.
(ISLA VERDE: EXT. ISLA VERDE - DAY)
Lisa Simpson: Hmm... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.
Crowd: (ROARS ITS APPROVAL)
Speedo Salesman: (KNOWING) Ah, yes. Top of the hill. Three discos up, four gelatos on the left. You can't miss it, it's right between the disco and the gelato place.
(CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO: ExT. CAFÉ ARTISTE GELATO - a little later)
Sabine: Welcome to Café Artiste! Would you like a glass of Strupo? It's a liqueur made of fermented capers, the official drink of the island.
Homer Simpson: Sounds delicious. (TAKES A SIP) It's not. (THEN) Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here.
Sabine: Oh, yes, I remember that painting. And that is the man I sold it to.
Homer Simpson: And that man sold it to me!
Homer Simpson: That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
Homer Simpson: I love art!
KLAUS ZIEGLER: (SLIGHT GERMAN ACCENT) Art? What do you know about art? You don't even know who painted that picture.
Lisa Simpson: Yes we do. It's a Johan Oldenveldt.
KLAUS ZIEGLER: Wrong! It's a me!
Lisa Simpson: What?
KLAUS ZIEGLER: I painted it! Me, Klaus Ziegler!
Homer Simpson: Who?
(CLIFFSIDE VILLA: ext. cliffside villa - a little later)
(ZEIGLER'S STUDIO: INT. zeigler'S STUDIO - continuous)
Lisa Simpson: (IMPRESSED NOISES)
KLAUS ZIEGLER: This is where I painted your so-called Oldenveldt.
Homer Simpson: Prove it.
Homer Simpson: Oh... crap.
Lisa Simpson: You're a... forger?
KLAUS ZIEGLER: Forger is such a cruel word. I'm an art forger.
KLAUS ZIEGLER: Your painting was an early, clumsy effort which I gave to the café owner to pay off my Strupo tab.
KLAUS ZIEGLER: (DISGUSTED SHUDDER)
Homer Simpson: Then why did the auction house say it was real?
KLAUS ZIEGLER: I have fooled galleries around the world with my loving imitations.
KLAUS ZIEGLER: Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler! Ziegler!
Lisa Simpson: What you do is horrible: ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.
KLAUS ZIEGLER: Perhaps you are the one who is horrible.
Lisa Simpson: What!?
Homer Simpson: Now let's play human foosball! (BLOWS WHISTLE)
KLAUS ZIEGLER: You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.
Lisa Simpson: (HEMMING AND HAWING) Well... no, but now when I look at it all I'll see is a fraud.
KLAUS ZIEGLER: Beauty is beauty. My "forgeries" give pleasure to people all over the world.
KLAUS ZIEGLER: The only real question to ask about art, whether it's in the Louvre or on a freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton, is "Did it move you?"
Lisa Simpson: But, you still, I mean... (SIGHS) I suppose you're right.
Homer Simpson: What if I never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?
KLAUS ZIEGLER: Then you, I respect.
Lisa Simpson: (ANNOYED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: Oh, great. The painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. And when Marge finds out she's gonna kill me.
KLAUS ZIEGLER: Well, on that front, perhaps I can be of assistance. If there's one thing art is good for, it's to melt the frost which often hardens a woman's heart.
Homer Simpson: While you're at it... could you make me a couple more?
Homer Simpson: (SELLING) I'll pay you in Strupo...
(Van Houten Home: INT. VAN HOUTEN hOUSE - DAY)
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - DAY)
Marge Simpson: Oh, perfect. Now that's art.
Homer Simpson: Rockin'
Narrator: The Gray Troll, Brine of Madness, Angel's Urine... All names for the mysterious elixir known as Strupo. Though this fermented caper solution was originally used to dissolve seagull corpses, local alcoholics soon found Strupo to be a palatable drink of last resort. The noxious liqueur causes powerful olfactory hallucinations, gender confusion, and wandering mouth. So if you visit Isla Verde, be sure to say "ahoy" to the crushing addiction of Strupo. (SLOGAN) Strupo: lose everything.

Gary Chalmers: (CHUCKLES) Well, I, uh... (THEN) Respect. That's what these kids lack. So we will hold a contest to make them tell us who they respect. Who their heroes are.
Seymour Skinner: A contest? But, sir, we don't have any money to pay for prizes. We had to rent out our multi-purpose room to a Japanese-American social club.
(MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM: int. multi-purpose room - meanwhile)

Ezra: Tell us your hero and you could win a Stuffwich college scholarship.
Ezra: Then you can be a hero like me.

Lisa Simpson: Everyone does that.
Bart Simpson: Everyone does that with good dads. But with our Dad, it's like climbing Mount Everest. You either plant your flag at the top of the world or get frozen in agony forever. Either way, Hell of a show.
Seymour Skinner: People, please! Martin has left the building. He had an orthodontist appointment.
Lisa Simpson: (AGGRAVATED MOAN) Okay, Dad's my hero. Why is he my hero?

Homer Simpson: The trick is, wait several weeks.
Lisa Simpson: ...And when my Dad was a soccer referee, he had the guts to red card me, his only talking daughter, because he knew I was diving.
Lisa Simpson: In the history of soccer, he's the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid, and he was right. He made me a better person, because that's what heroes do.
Lisa Simpson: (REPEATING) That's what heroes do.
Homer Simpson: (SNIFFLES) I'm so glad I was forced to come.
Gary Chalmers: (STANDING) People, people... we have a tie!

Homer Simpson: (SHRUGS) The stomach wants what it wants. (SMALL BURP) I need some air.
(Restaurant: ext. RESTAURANT - later that night)
Homer Simpson: Ah, Brazil. I couldn't stay afraid of you forever. The only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. That is a deal breaker.
Antonio: Homer Simpson! I would like to congratulate you on your fine officiating today.
Homer Simpson: Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
Antonio: Your disbelief will fade with time. But now, I would like to know if you are as "incorruptível" as they say.
Antonio: Oh, that is where I left my cellphone.
Antonio: Well?
Homer Simpson: (WITH GRIT) You don't know the new me of the last few days at all!
Antonio: We will get to him. We have our ways.
2nd Gambler: What other ways besides guns and money?
Antonio: We have two ways. Two very good ways.
Homer Simpson: Red card!
Player: (SPANISH ACCENT) Let me give that back to you.
Homer Simpson: Get outta here!
(Lisa's Bedroom: Int. lisa's bedroom - evening)
Announcer #1: And as Homer officiates, looks like we've got a little action on the bribe cam.
(Rio de Janeiro: Int. RIO DE JANEIRO - hotel ROOM - late afternoon)
Bart Simpson: Man, Krusty should get some of these letters.
Bart Simpson: While you were out, the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts, a chocolate bowling ball, and a fresh pork sandwich.
Homer Simpson: (FIGHTING) How fresh?
Pig: (LOUD SQUEAL)
Homer Simpson: (EXASPERATED NOISE) Where's your mother?
Bart Simpson: Went to practice her Portuguese.
(Hotel: Int. hotel - atm)
Marge Simpson: (READING) "Selecionar conta..." (THINKS) ooh, "select account"!
Samba Instructor: (JULIO VOICE) Uh, perhaps you could select the "English" option!
Marge Simpson: I did not pay seven ninety-nine for an app so I could use the English option.
Samba Instructor: You Americans, you really throw your seven ninety-nines around.
Marge Simpson: You know, you're pretty rude.
Samba Instructor: (MOCKING LAUGH) Stupid lady.
(Rio de Janeiro: Int. RIO DE JANEIRO - hotel ROOM - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Give the donuts to the hotel staff. Release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild.
Bart Simpson: Dad, is it hard for you to turn these bribes down?
Homer Simpson: Yes. But knowing that Lisa chose me as her hero... without ever considering any other hero... keeps me strong.
Homer Simpson: Why so quiet?
Bart Simpson: I'm just examining what kind of person I am and whether I should destroy your happiness forever. (THINKS) Eh, why not?
Homer Simpson: I'm listening. And it better be devastating.
Bart Simpson: You weren't Lisa's hero. She just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.
Homer Simpson: Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy.
Bart Simpson: Where are you going?
Homer Simpson: To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!
Bart Simpson: Now that's a broken man.
(Hotel: Int. hotel - hallway - continuous)
Man In Robe: (PORTUGUESE ACCENT) What the Hell are you doing?
Man In Robe: (PORTUGUESE ACCENT) Oh, oh. Okay.
(RIO: Ext. Rio - night - establishing)
(SEEDY BAR: Int. seedy bar - continuous)
Antonio: So the rumors are true. (PUTS HAND ON HOMER) We knew you'd find out your daughter's original speech topic was Marie Curie. And now we need you to fix the greatest game of all: the World Cup Final.
Homer Simpson: Fine. Marge is always complaining I never fix things. (TO BARTENDER) Give me another.
Bartender: All right. But we've run out of sugarcane.
Homer Simpson: I carry my own.
Antonio: All right, Homer. To begin your descent into Hell, let us enjoy this pirated copy of "Man of Steel." But beware: Superman was never less fun. (EVIL LAUGH)
(RIO: Ext. rio - morning)
Announcer #2: (IRISH) Here it is, the World Cup Final.
(DRYCLEANERS: Ext. drycleaners - day)

(STADIUM: ext. stadium - a little later)
Brazil Fan: (TO GERMANS, PORTUGUESE ACCENT) Nazis!
German Fan: (TO BRAZILIANS, GERMAN ACCENT) Nazi harborers!
Older German Man: Guys, guys, you're both right.
(REFEREE'S TUNNEL: int. referee's tunnel - continuous)
Homer Simpson: If I bet it, I could double it. But on who? (STROKES CHIN)
Antonio: You know that Brazil is going to win!
Homer Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Thanks for telling me. I was gonna tape it.
Antonio: Remember, I'll be watching.
Homer Simpson: Wave a Brazilian flag so you'll stand out in the crowd.
Lisa Simpson: Don't do it, Dad. Don't cheat.
Homer Simpson: (HURT) You're a funny one to tell me about deception.
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry you weren't my first choice. In fact... (SMALL MOAN) I had my doubts about using you at all.
Homer Simpson: Well, if we're going to be brutally honest, that drawing you made of me when you were three was far from a perfect likeness.
Lisa Simpson: You put it on the fridge!
Homer Simpson: It was pity-fridged!
Lisa Simpson: All right, you're hurt. I understand. But when I made you my hero, you lived up to it and more. You became the hero I thought you could be, Dad.
Homer Simpson: (INCREDIBLY-TOUCHED NOISE) Oh, come here.
Homer Simpson: Everything's right with the world.
Homer Simpson: That's all right, brain. If I die, I'll be doing the thing I love the most: trying not to get killed.
(STADIUM: Int. Stadium - later)
Announcer #2: This match is tighter than two dogs on a summer morn.
Announcer #2: There's no score at all. Even the slightest pebble could start a landslide.
Announcer #1: And El Divo goes down! In the box! will Homer award a penalty kick to Brazil?
Antonio: Do it! Do it! Call the penalty!
Lisa Simpson: No penalty! He dove, Dad!
Homer Simpson: No penalty!
Homer Simpson: I repeat, no penalty!
Homer Simpson: No penalty!
Announcer #1: The game, plus two hours of funeral time, is about to conclude.
Announcer #2: And with Germany the victor, two-nil, in an unprecedented display of rectitude and stubbornness by one Homer Simpson!
Announcer #1: I've never seen the Brazilians so depressed.
Brazilians: (VERY SADLY) OLÉ / OLÉ, OLÉ, OLÉ.
Antonio: You broke a deal with us. And we have lost a fortune.
Homer Simpson: Well, at least I'll die the American way. In a foreign country wearing short pants.
Marge Simpson: Wait, wait, wait, wait! I wanna say something!
Antonio: You have one minute. (LOOKS AT ANALOG WATCH) Wait. Let it get to the twelve. Nnnow!
Marge Simpson: (NERVOUS) Um... Deixar meu marido sozinho!
Bart Simpson: How's she doin' that?
Lisa Simpson: I don't know, but she's my new hero.
Marge Simpson: (TO LISA) Yeah, I was a little surprised I wasn't considered before. (TO GAMBLERS) Todo o meu marido se preocupa é ser um herói para sua filha. Por favor, perdoa-lhe.
Antonio: Your fluency is impressive. You can help my son learn Hebrew for his bar mitzvah. But I am still killing your husband.
Marge Simpson: First, mazel tov! Second, don't! Please, please, I'm a mother. Surely you have a mother too.
Antonio: I do have a mother. Oh, she's right there.
Brazilian Lady: I'm sorry, my son. We owe a debt to the Simpsons that can never be repaid.
Carl Carlson: (EGGING HIM ON) Ho-mer, Ho-mer--
Antonio: All that she did was switch seats on a plane!
Brazilian Lady: On a fifteen hour flight!
Antonio: (TO SIMPSONS) You are free to go.
(Graveyard: Ext. graveyard - late afternoon)
Homer Simpson: No penalty.
El Divo: Fine.
(AMAZON RIVER: ext. amazon river - day)
Lisa Simpson: Wow, the Amazon is just like I pictured it after seeing all those pictures online.
Homer Simpson: (NODS) I've never seen anything so beautiful.

Homer Simpson: (INCREDIBLY LOUD SNORE)
Homer Simpson: (WAKES UP) Hey-hey, what--
Homer Simpson: (MOAN) Cleats.
Marge Simpson: (GROANS) Homie, what happened?
Homer Simpson: Um... maybe some easy-listening music will make you feel better about the story. Turn on eighty-nine point nine.
Homer Simpson: Like most of my problems, it all started at Moe's...
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - night)
Carl Carlson: All right, so the rules are, every time the news guy says "senator," we gotta take a drink.
Lenny Leonard: It'll be nice to let someone else decide when I drink. Too much pressure.
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, Channel Six tip line? I just caught two senators doin' it in the alley. And me? I'm just a reliable source. Not "sauce," "source"! Source! "S-A-U-R-C-E"!
Kent Brockman: (TOUCHES EARPIECE) We have heard from a very reliable sauce, news involving multiple senators.
Kent Brockman: I will read a list of senators...with possibly more senators...to be named later by other senators:
Kent Brockman: Senator Abercrombie, Senator Billingsley, Senator Beaumont...
Moe Szyslak: Oh damn, the plaster's flaking again.
(PLAYGROUND: Ext. playground - late that night)
Homer Simpson: Once intoxicated, we had a great idea.
Lenny Leonard: (WASTED) Hey, swings!
Lenny Leonard: I'm a kid again!
Carl Carlson: I'll save you!
Carl Carlson: (ANGUISHED) The only way out is in!
Homer Simpson: Hey! Look at me! I'm going up a slide!
Homer Simpson: Best recess ever! (FALLING NOISE)
Homer Simpson: Help me guys! Guys?
Carl Carlson: Don't worry, Homer. I'll call the cops!
Lenny Leonard: I'll write my senator!
Carl Carlson: Senator!
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Am I gonna die on a playground, like some uncoordinated child?
Homer Simpson: (PHILOSOPHICAL) But I did learn something from all this. The sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.
Softball Player: (SARCASTIC) Thanks for throwing the ball back. Really.
Marge Simpson: (WEARY SIGH) I'll come back with the fire truck. I just have to get the kids to school first.
Homer Simpson: Oh, are the kids with you?
Bart Simpson: Hi, Dad! / Homer.
Homer Simpson: Hey, guys! Why are you ducked down like that?
Bart Simpson: Don't want to be seen with you when you're hitting bottom.
Lisa Simpson: At least we hope it's bottom.
Homer Simpson: Don't worry. It's bottom all right.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MOAN)
(Skinner's Office: Int. Skinner's office - a little later)
Bart Simpson: And that's why I was tardy today.
Seymour Skinner: And with that tardiness, you have at last crossed the boundary where I can legally apply physical discipline.
Seymour Skinner: Willie! Cut me a switch!
(Springfield Elementary School: Ext. school - continuous)
Groundskeeper Willie: What about the one your ma used on you?
Seymour Skinner: It uh, broke on my buttocks.
Groundskeeper Willie: Serves you right for eating jam straight out of the jar.
Seymour Skinner: Dammit! That's not even a swivel chair!
(Springfield Street: Ext. Springfield street - day)
Seymour Skinner: Skate! Skate! As fast as you can. / But I'll catch you, I'm the Principal Man! (BEAT) That's the kind of education you're missing.
Seymour Skinner: Oh no! Uphill! The one place my car can't go.
(BODY SHOP OFFICE: iNT. body shop office - continuous)
Body Shop Clerk: (WISEGUY) Would you like a quote?
Body Shop Clerk: "Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go." Oscar Wilde. P.S., your car is totaled.

Bart Simpson: Whoo! Safe!
Voice: (JAILBIRD) Oh, not totally...
Bart Simpson: (TERRIFIED NOISE) Wha-- what are you doing in here?
Snake Jailbird: Hiding from the cops.
Bart Simpson: Well, I can't have cops sniffin' around here. Some of them might be girls.
Snake Jailbird: Can't I just stay a little? I only committed this robbery to help my kid.
Snake Jailbird: See, that's Jeremy. I need to get him braces. I always thought that if I'd had braces I'd have smiled more.
Bart Simpson: Hey, I bet you have a great smile.
Bart Simpson: Ay carumba!
Chief Wiggum: Bart, Bart! We're in whatchamacallit... a pursuit!
Bart Simpson: So why'd you come here? I run a respectable treehouse.
Chief Wiggum: Just wondering if you've seen anything. Word is you'll, uh, you'll snitch for candy.
Bart Simpson: You can't buy me with a candy bar that has coconut.
Chief Wiggum: Maybe this is more your neighborhood.
Bart Simpson: Nice real estate. You've got a deal.
Chief Wiggum: So, what do you know?
Bart Simpson: I saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo say he was gonna hide out on top of Mount Springfield.
Chief Wiggum: Mount Springfield, eh? Strap on your crampons, boys!
Chief Wiggum: Eddie! Prepare my litter!
Chief Wiggum: Lou, you are responsible for my oxygen, food, water, and cleaning! You have to clean me.
Snake Jailbird: Dude, thank you. Why did you save me?
Bart Simpson: (NODS) We outlaws have to stick together.
Snake Jailbird: Outlaw? You?
Bart Simpson: Stolen bowling shoes, 3-D glasses, Krusty standee...and this (AIR QUOTES) "cage" for my pet.
Snake Jailbird: What do you feed him?
Bart Simpson: My A.D.D. meds.
Snake Jailbird: (CHUCKLES) Listen, would you like two tickets to the school musical. (OMINOUS) My son plays the butcher... (FRIENDLY) in "Fiddler on the Roof."

Lucas: (GASPS, THEN:) Merci beaucoup!
Lisa Simpson: (PLEASED) Oh, well, you're very wel--
Lucas: That's French for: Hello.
Lisa Simpson: Actually, I think it--
Lucas: Lucas Bortner, competitive eater.
Milhouse Van Houten: (TO SELF) A fat kid with a dream?! I can't compete with that!
Lisa Simpson: What does a competitive eater eat?
Lucas: All the glamor foods: pizza, boiled eggs, chicken wings, and the big enchilada, which is not enchiladas but hotdogs.
Lucas: Sixty-nine hot dogs is the current record. As the great Kobayashi says, (JAPANESE) "Detekurutoki itaiyo."
Lisa Simpson: What does that mean?
Lucas: "That's going to hurt coming out."
Lisa Simpson: Is Kobayashi the number one... um... uh...
Lucas: The correct term is "gurgitator."
Lisa Simpson: I won't be using the correct term then.
Lucas: Virtually everyone uses his technique: "Japanesing." (TEMPTING) Shall I demonstrate?
Lisa Simpson: Um, why don't I just go sit alone and--(REALIZING) Oh, you're doing it.
Lucas: Ready... set... Japanese!
Lucas: (GAGS) Nope, no. That's not going down. (GAGS UP HOTDOG CHUNKS) This happens from time to time.
Lisa Simpson: Maybe this isn't the sport for you.
Lucas: It's not a sport. It's my life.
Lisa Simpson: Can I join you for lunch?
Lucas: Um, sure. How many whole pizzas would you like?
Lisa Simpson: Um, can I just have a slice?
Lucas: (IMPRESSED) Interesting technique.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BART'S ROOM - DAY)
Bart Simpson: Whoa.
Milhouse Van Houten: You didn't tell me you had a PlayStadium Four!
Bart Simpson: (PUZZLED) It's the first I've seen it.
Milhouse Van Houten: Something's fishy, Bart. Where's the gift receipt? Where's the packet of desiccant that says "do not eat," and believe me, you shouldn't.
Bart Simpson: (GETTING IT) I have a feeling this PlayStadium was "liberated" from its previous owner and given to me in gratitude.
Milhouse Van Houten: "Liberated?" You mean "stolen?"
Bart Simpson: You can't spell "crime" without "me."
Milhouse Van Houten: C-r-i- (SMALL GASP) there it is, at the end!
Lucas: Oh hi, is-is Lisa home?
MARGE 7: Yes, she is. And who are you?
Marge Simpson: (READING) Lucas.
Lucas: It's pronounced "Luca-dollar". That's my competition name. I'm a competitive eater.
Homer Simpson: Competitive eater? Did I hear right? I could be a competitive eater?
Marge Simpson: No! You didn't hear anything!
Homer Simpson: Yes I did! I heard "competitive eater"!
Marge Simpson: It's for people who haven't had heart problems!
Homer Simpson: (ENTERING) Then that makes me the Jackie Robinson of the sport. And you are the racist Philadelphia manager!
Marge Simpson: Quit comparing me to Ben Chapman!
Homer Simpson: I will when you open your mind to change!
Marge Simpson: (AGGRAVATED MURMUR)
Lucas: So, what should we practice: um, Vienna sausage; blueberry pie -- short form; oatmeal -- long course; freestyle baked beans; catfish; ooh! cow brains...
Lisa Simpson: Beans, beans. We'll do beans.
Patty Bouvier: Huh. Never saw the pork eat the beans before.
Patty Bouvier: (LAUGH)
Marge Simpson: Actually, I'm a little surprised Lisa likes him.
Patty Bouvier: Really? "Justin Blobber" over there doesn't remind you of anyone?
Homer Simpson: Eight hundred dollars to cut me outta that slide? It's all about the money with those firemen.
Selma Bouvier: Women marry their fathers, Marge.
Selma Bouvier: So you just might be meeting your future ton-in-law.
Selma Bouvier: (CHORTLE)
Patty Bouvier: God bless us.
Marge Simpson: (ALARMED) You can do better!
(Simpson Master Bedroom: Int. Simpson BEDROOM - dawn)
Homer Simpson: She can smash a salad.
Homer Simpson: ("DOG RUNNING IN HIS SLEEP" NOISES)
Homer Simpson: What the?
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS)
Lisa Simpson: (GINGERLY) Maybe you're not cut out for competitive eating.
Lucas: (UPSET) Are you calling me not fat?
Lisa Simpson: No, I'm just, I... maybe you just haven't found the right food. Huh? How 'bout ice cream?
Lucas: (NODS) Yes! I will lay some hurt on that cream!
Lucas: Oh my God! Brain freeze! Oh my God! Kick me in the head till I pass out.
Lucas: Harder. I'm still conscious! You must kick me harder!
Adult Lucas: (GROWNUP VOICE) Thanks, babe. Sorry you had to drop out of college to feed me full time. Now give us a kiss.

Bart Simpson: Huh? It's full of lame apps: Bully Avoider, Nosebook, Insta-Grandma, (GASP) This was stolen from Milhouse!
Milhouse Van Houten: From my backpack! Where Puppy Goo-Goo sleeps! Maybe it's time to tell me exactly what's going on!
Bart Simpson: Relax! Listen to the music of this bubble game.
Milhouse Van Houten: (DREAMY) So peaceful... (SHAKING HEAD) No! I won't let this go! Bart, it's time you told me how you've been getting all this stuff.
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) I helped Snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff. It was an honorable arrangement. But I never thought he'd steal from you.
Milhouse Van Houten: Snake, eh? I never would've suspected the one criminal in town.
Milhouse Van Houten: (SNEAKY CHUCKLE)
Bart Simpson: You seem stressed.
Bart Simpson: You wanna suck some Squishee?
Milhouse Van Houten: Sure.
Bart Simpson: Careful. It's uncut syrup. They give it to horses before they race.
Marge's Thoughts: My sisters are nuts. I'm happy being married to Homer. Most of the time.
Kent Brockman: Jailbird, A.K.A. Snake -- that's his real name, Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake, has been arrested for a series of thefts and may be put to death under a controversial new statute.
Bart Simpson: (GASPS)
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, we had a law stating (TOUGH) "Three strikes and you're out," but I thought it was: (PLEASANT) "You're out!" So I let people go. So now it's (TOUGH) "Four balls and you walk! Right to the electric chair!" It's, uh, much clearer, Kent.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, I'm so sorry. I just wanted to ruin his life, not end it.
Bart Simpson: You ratted him out? (SMALL SCOFF) He's got a kid!
Milhouse Van Houten: A kid? (WORRIED) I was crushed when I lost my Dad and all he did was move to the Holiday Inn. (WISTFUL) I can still see him smoking on the balcony. He looked like he missed something... maybe me!
Bart Simpson: So you see, we can't let Jailbird fry.
Milhouse Van Houten: Time for the Sleepover Detectives!
Bart Simpson: I didn't say there'd be a sleepover.
Milhouse Van Houten: Too bad, 'cause I'm wearing my pajamas under my clothes.
Milhouse Van Houten: And my swimsuit under those.
Milhouse Van Houten: One day it'll all pay off.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson House - BEdroom - night)
Marge Simpson: Oh, there's my magazine. Why, look at this! (READS) "What every father should do for his daughter."
Homer Simpson: (GROANS) Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. Don't hide behind a magazine.
Marge Simpson: Right, right, right, right. (READING) According to Judy Kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. Then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!
Homer Simpson: (CAN'T BELIEVE HIS GOOD LUCK) Wait. Let me get this straight. Sit and eat? That's my punishment?
Marge Simpson: It's not a punishment. But you can't just eat dinner. You have to be gentlemanly and attentive.
Homer Simpson: Oh, I can fake attentive. I've been watching a football game this whole discussion.
Marge Simpson: Not fake attentive. Real attentive.
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay. We'll make it fun. I'll take her to that crab place. All the crabs you could smash.
Marge Simpson: You know Lisa's a vegetarian.
Marge Simpson: (FRUSTRATED) No! Homer, you can't just do the things you want to do. You have to act like someone you'd want Lisa to marry. If you just act like yourself, she might just... (CATCHING HERSELF NOISE) Oh, you know? (MOANS)
Homer Simpson: She might marry someone like me? (REALIZING, STUNNED) You think that would be bad!?
Marge Simpson: (GENTLY) Homie, I love you. But you can be a challenge, like doing the Daily Jumble.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!
Marge Simpson: Well, I was just trying to--
Homer Simpson: (COLDLY) I'm sleeping on Flanders' couch tonight. Ours is crap.
(Moe's Tavern: ext. moe's - night - establishing)

Moe Szyslak: Now you quit stallin' and call your daughter like a man!
Homer Simpson: (GROANS) Feels weird.

Chief Wiggum: Plea denied! (CALLS O.S.) Warm up the electric chair, Lou!
Chief Wiggum: (AGGRAVATED MOAN) You're not done yet?
Lou: The instructions are in Swedish, Chief. We got this from "IKILLYA."
Snake Jailbird: Yo, I totally speak Swedish.
Chief Wiggum: Fluently?
Snake Jailbird: (SARCASTIC) Um, ja.
Chief Wiggum: Uh, do what he says, Lou.
Lou: But Chief...

Chief Wiggum: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Let him out, Lou. Let him out!
Lou: But Chief, we've got guns, he's got a little wrench.
Chief Wiggum: It's cold!
Lou: (SIGHS, THEN QUIETLY) All right.
Snake Jailbird: Thanks for coming down, Bart. (MEANINGFUL) You won't need to save me a third time.
Bart Simpson: (HOPEFULLY) You're going straight?
Snake Jailbird: If I get caught, it's suicide by cop.
Chief Wiggum: Oh, I don't like the sound of that.
Snake Jailbird: It means I get you to shoot me, dude.
Chief Wiggum: Yeah, still sounds like a lot of paperwork.

Homer Simpson: Um. Excuse me, Lisa.
Homer Simpson: A friend from high school.

20-something Wife: It's just... (SMALL SOB) we've been trying so hard to start a family. With all the money we've spent on I.V.F.... you have no idea...
Bart Simpson: (SOFTENING) Hm, maybe I can help. But it'll cost you.
20-something Husband: How much?
Bart Simpson: Five dollars. Plus one dollar haw-haw insurance.
Nelson Muntz: Trust me, the insurance is worth it.

(Springfield Elementary School Playground: Ext. school playground - day - a few weeks later)
20-something Husband: (GETTING OUT) No haw-haw! It worked!
20-something Wife: I'm pregnant!
20-something Husband: Look Bart, I really, I can't believe there's a connection here. But, uh, we have some friends who are in the same dark place we were. Can we give them your name?
Bart Simpson: Only if they have five dollars.
20-something Husband: (ROLLS EYES) Yes, right. I'll make sure that they have five dollars.
Bart Simpson: With them.
20-something Husband: Look, I'm sorry our check bounced, man. I can have the bank teller call you.

(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - day - a little later)
Homer Simpson: What is your problem, boy?
Bart Simpson: Maybe when I've got a Dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, I don't know, a low bar?
Homer Simpson: Wow. I've gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts.
Bart Simpson: Aren't those full of germs?
Homer Simpson: Eat the nuts! They're your dinner!
Legs: You guys are comin' with us.
Moe Szyslak: Not so fast.
Moe Szyslak: Nobody comes into my bar and kidnaps two paying customers.
Homer Simpson: (GRATEFUL) Thanks, Moe, I... (PATS PANTS) huh. Must've left my wallet at home.
Moe Szyslak: (LOWERING SHOTGUN) Take 'em! Take 'em! Fill their pockets with corn and toss 'em to the pigs.

Fat Tony: That's right, Fat Homer.
Homer Simpson: (OFFENDED) Hey!
Fat Tony: I need your boy to make a baby.
Homer Simpson: Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the (ARM MOTIONS OVER THE FOLLOWING) bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop.
Fat Tony: You sound like every doctor I've ever been to. But it's not for me. It's for her.
Fat Tony: Meet my filly, Cheesesteak, the love of my life.
Fat Tony: (KISSING NOISES, THEN) Who has apple breath? You has apple breath. (ETC.)
Fat Tony: And this horse, who I have briefly "borrowed," is the winner of last year's Springfield Stakes -- Rear Admiral. So work your magic and breed me a champion.
Bart Simpson: (SCARED) Look, Fat Tony. I don't know what you know about voodoo, but it only works on people. Horses? That's crazy talk!
Fat Tony: (SUDDENLY FURIOUS) You will breed me a champion by morning... or it will be the last sunrise you ever see.
Louie: Don't over-promise, boss. It might be overcast.
Fat Tony: How'd you like a cast over your face?
Louie: Well, as long as there were breathe holes...
Louie: Y'know. Just sayin'.
Homer Simpson: (SCARED) Well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it.
Fat Tony: One more thing -- it better be a boy.
Homer Simpson: (ROLLS EYES) Anything else?
Fat Tony: It would be helpful if he could go undercover with police horses and find out what they know.
Bart Simpson: (PISSED-OFF) Hey, this is all your fault.
Homer Simpson: How is it my fault?
Homer Simpson: LET THEM RUCK THE NIGHT AWAY!
Bart Simpson: I wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! Pub crawls, naked Frisbee golf...
Homer Simpson: I just did that because it was a series of funny words!
Bart Simpson: Well, it's your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to Hell!
Homer Simpson: Huh? Maybe you're right, boy. It's time I was a better father. And I'll start by saving us. I just need to facilitate some horse intercourse.
Homer Simpson: Come on, buddy. Just make a champion thoroughbred and we're outta here.
Bart Simpson: What's his problem?
Homer Simpson: Hey, you know, I don't think this guy likes girls.
Bart Simpson: Big deal. I don't like girls either.

Marge Simpson: Marge Simpson. Congratulations on little King George.
Booth: Well, Marge. My wife and I are hosting a get-to-know-you game night on Saturday next. Or as you call it "next Saturday."
Marge Simpson: (INTRIGUED) Ooh! Game night?
Booth: You know, adult games. Well not (AIR QUOTE) "adult" games. Fun games like "Charades" (SHA-RODS). Or as you call it, "Pictionary."
Marge Simpson: That sounds like fun. I'll just tell Homer and--
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Homer! For the last time, do not drink the Yahtzee dice!

Marge Simpson: I want friends. Any friends.
Homer Simpson: (KINDLY) Okay, sweetie, I'll call the Van Houtens.
Marge Simpson: Not the Van Houtens.
Homer Simpson: But...
Marge Simpson: They're always bragging about their trip to Rome. It was twelve years ago and it was a layover. I want new friends!
Lisa Simpson: Can I make an observation?
Lisa Simpson: I'm okay with no friends. It's easier to focus and it'll give me great material for whatever art form I choose. Right now I'm thinking long novella. (CHEERY) Goodnight!
Marge Simpson: (STUNNED) "Okay with no friends." That's the saddest thing I can imagine my daughter saying to me.
Bart Simpson: I can think of worse.
Bart Simpson: The saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting Lisa, and you hit her. And the last thing she texted, before she died, was "I got your message." G'night.
Homer Simpson: (CONSIDERING NOISE) They all make good points.
Announcer: And now, the moment of truth on "Topiary Wars."

Marge Simpson: We're going to that game party and we're going to be charming and witty.
Marge Simpson: You're not going to eat too much, and we're not going to stay too late.
Marge Simpson: You will not sing unless there's a sing-along, and never take the tray out of the caterer's hand.
Marge Simpson: Don't be too loud and don't be too quiet. When you're too quiet, you get that psycho look.
Homer Simpson: (CREEPY LITTLE LAUGH)

Party Guests: (EXCITED GASPS)
Booth: Please, everyone read your bio.
Sideshow Mel: (READING CARD) I am a humble farmer from Yorkshire. (BOOMING MEL VOICE) Humble I can be!
Booth: That's the spirit! Wallis and I have found this game to provide a full evening of (FRENCH ACCENT) divertissement, building in suspense to a masterful climax.

(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - establishing - morning)
Homer Simpson: Okay, I slept on the couch, and I flipped the sweaty cushions over. What else can I do?
Marge Simpson: (CUTTING HIM OFF) It's okay. I mean, those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place. I think it's time we learned to live with being ostracized.
Homer Simpson: Mmmm--
Marge Simpson: Don't you dare say "ostrich eyes."
Homer Simpson: (NOT SURE WHY) Because... (OFF HER LOOK) Oh. Oh, okay, okay. What should we do?
Marge Simpson: Nothing. I give up. No more dinner parties. Our whole social life will be us watching TV and you going to Moe's.
Homer Simpson: (NODS) I see.
Homer Simpson: (TO MAGGIE, CONTAINING JOY) Woo-hoo!
Homer Simpson: (SOLEMN) Well, if that's how you think it has to be.
Marge Simpson: Yes, for us. But not for Lisa! Never for Lisa. We're going to help her make friends.
Homer Simpson: It might be easier with Maggie. She's always getting letters from the Daycare center.
Marge Simpson: Those are past-due bills.
Marge Simpson: And Lisa will get a friend.
Lisa Simpson: (TO DOG) After this we'll do makeovers!
Homer Simpson: So... where are all the friends?
Marge Simpson: I don't know! I invited everyone that Lisa's ever met.
Homer Simpson: Who are you?
WISEGUY BOY: Gus Huebner. I was on Lisa's coed soccer team two years ago.
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Well, Lisa's going to be here in five minutes, and the only kid who showed up is Gus Frickin' Huebner!
GUS HUEBNER: Watch your mouth.
Marge Simpson: Oh! Oh no, you're right, Homer! Abort! Abort!
GUS HUEBNER: Oh, no. I was the only chump who showed up at this train wreck. Well, I'm not leaving till I get a party.
Marge Simpson: Fine, fine! Homer! Give him a party!
Lisa Simpson: Gus Huebner? Is that you?
GUS HUEBNER: (LAUGHS) I wish. That kid could play youth soccer. (WALKS OFF)
Lisa Simpson: Are you guys okay?
Marge Simpson: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. I'm fine.

(Springfield Elementary School: Int. springfield elementary - gym - day)
Coach Krupt: All right. For some reason, square-dancing is a part of the gym curriculum. Now I'm gonna open the divider to the girls' gym and if you don't find a dance partner within ten seconds, there is something very wrong with you.
Coach Krupt: That's tough luck, Lisa. Looks like you're dancin' with Groundskeeper Willie.
Groundskeeper Willie: Careful of your toes. I've got me cleats on!
Tumi: I'll dance with Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: Tumi? But you're from the other second grade. We only come together for tornado drills.
Coach Krupt: (DISGUSTED NOISE) God, I hate square-dancing. It ain't gym class if a fat kid's not crying. Let's do this thing.

Milhouse Van Houten: (ENTERING FRAME) And I'm gonna help you.
Bart Simpson: I think I'll need you back at headquarters manning the phones.

Bart Simpson: Just let 'em ring.
Milhouse Van Houten: Got it!
Lisa Simpson: What do you want?
Bart Simpson: I've got two things for you: this envelope will change your life for the low, low price of five dollars, and I'll throw in a piece of great advice. Tempted?
Lisa Simpson: What's the advice?
Bart Simpson: Don't open the envelope.
Lisa Simpson: Oh God, I'm gonna be sick!
Lisa Simpson: (GASPS) Mom paid her to be my friend? (SOBS)
Bart Simpson: That's mine. It's for my library card.
(Simpson Home: Int. simpson house - kitchen - night - (moments later))
Lisa Simpson: (TO DOG) You don't want to be here.
Lisa Simpson: (TO HOMER) Neither do you!
Lisa Simpson: (NEAR TEARS) Mom, how could you pay someone to be my friend?!
Lisa Simpson: Answer me!
Marge Simpson: (VERY WORRIED MURMUR) I wouldn't say I paid someone to be your friend. I just gave her money for records and ice cream.
Homer Simpson: You gave away ice cream?!
Lisa Simpson: I would've found a friend eventually. You couldn't wait a damn decade until I got into college? (SOBS)
Marge Simpson: Lisa. Lisa, wait...
Homer Simpson: Oh God, oh God, I'm the smart parent.
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry she rejected your "I'm Sorry," cake, but in a way, I'm not. I guess what I'm trying to say is I like cake.
Grampa Simpson: Marge, don't feel bad. You did what any parent would do.
Marge Simpson: No. I think I went too far.
Grampa Simpson: Let me tell you a little story about a chubby, unpopular boy named Homer.
Homer Simpson: Is that the boy you named me after?
Grampa Simpson: It is you, you idjit! Little Homer had a devil of a time making friends. No one wanted to come visit him...
Grampa Simpson: So I decided to take matters into my own hands.
Grampa Simpson: I paid a couple boys, Lenny and Carl, to make my Homer feel loved.
Grampa Simpson: A relationship I continued to this day.
Homer Simpson: You pay Lenny and Carl to be my friends?
Grampa Simpson: Yes, but Barney's yours for nothin'.
Homer Simpson: (TOUCHED NOISE)

Lisa Simpson: Great! But from now on, we have to be totally honest with each other.
Tumi: You're absolutely right.
Tumi: I'm not really a vegetarian. Have you ever tried horse meat? They eat it raw in Japan, and--

Marge Simpson: The City's broke. The fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza.
Mother: (DISTRAUGHT) My baby... back ribs!
Homer Simpson: Marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into America's car window. (CHOKED UP) God bless her.

Gary Chalmers: And now, the climactic Race Around the School. Previous winners include Sideshow Mel, Señora Bumblebee Man...and Olympian Edwin Moses.
Seymour Skinner: I'll bet your biggest hurdle was leaving your beloved hometown.
Edwin Moses: All hurdles are the same size. Man, who is this loser?
Milhouse Van Houten: I've got a secret, Bart.
Bart Simpson: That's good.
Milhouse Van Houten: Wanna know it is?
Bart Simpson: No.
Milhouse Van Houten: My secret is I've been training for this race and no one suspects. Check it out: I'm wearing a dummy tummy. (LAUGHS)
Milhouse Van Houten: I'm gonna win and it'll change my life!

(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - closet - the present)
Gary Chalmers: As the runners go into the first turn, Lewis is in the lead! Followed by Lovejoy's daughter, Fat Tony's nephew, Brockman's little girl, and Jailbird's kid! The Frank Sinatra kid, well, he's doin' it his way! Rounding out the pack are all the kids that we never see. (SHOCKED) What's this? Milhouse takes the lead?! The same boy who sprained his shoulder doing the Pledge of Allegiance?!
DOLPH: Uh-oh. If Milhouse wins this race, we're out a fortune.
Jimbo Jones: Don't worry. The race takes a turn through the trees where no one can see. When Milhouse gets there, you know what to do.
Nelson Muntz: (NOT KNOWING) Oh, yeah. Totally. I mean, it's so obvious.
Jimbo Jones: (FED-UP) Just punch him.

Milhouse Van Houten: (SAD) The best day of my life just turned into every other day of my life.

Seymour Skinner: The winner is Bart Simpson!
Lisa Simpson: Bart won a blue ribbon... but was it worth it?
Marge Simpson: Lisa! Bath time!
Lisa Simpson: Mom! I'm narrating!

(Springfield Elementary School: ext. school - day)
Lisa Simpson: As the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through Bart's shirt and into its housing, the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Son! What happened to you in the dark place behind the school? Something good?
Milhouse Van Houten: (DAZED) I'm afraid I don't remember.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: It looks like Milhouse has traumatic amnesia. He may never remember what happened to him. (SERIOUS) The most important thing is: the race results are now official.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Now I've got to look at some severe cases of ice cream headache.

Little Homer: Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!
Little Homer: (INCREDIBLY ANGUISHED SCREAM)
Lisa Simpson: Fourth of July fireworks were a different story. They meant more to my Dad than my Mom could ever know.
(Park: ext. park - night)

Mona Simpson: I want to take a class!
Mona Simpson: I need space!
Lisa Simpson: With his mom gone, Homer needed a hero. And no one was a bigger hero than the magical little man behind the controls.
Little Homer: (SHY) Are you God?
Giuseppe: (ITALIAN, WILLIAM HICKEY) No, no, but I shoot rockets into his-a face. Here's-a my card. Don't forget to treasure it.

Homer Simpson: Giuseppe, I want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career.
Giuseppe: Why do you come here and remind me of a time in my life when I made a-tons of money doing a-what I love?
Homer Simpson: If the Expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten.
Giuseppe: (CONSIDERING) Well I am younger than Sylvester Stallone. I will do it!
(Van Houten Home: ext. van houten house - day)
Bart Simpson: Hey buddy.
Milhouse Van Houten: Bart, my truest friend.
Bart Simpson: I brought you a cake. Read it.
Milhouse Van Houten: That's an odd message, but who am I to argue with icing? Will you watch "Cassidy the Crocodile" with me?
Bart Simpson: Um... that's kind of a baby show.
Milhouse Van Houten: It's all I can handle now.
Cassidy The Crocodile: (KIND OF DUMB) Henrietta Kitten, will you marry me?
Henrietta Kitten: Meow, meow, maybe!
Bart Simpson: Why would a kitten marry a crocodile? Wouldn't it eat her?
Milhouse Van Houten: Shush. Suspension of disbelief.
Cassidy The Crocodile: Friends help friends in trouble.
Bart Simpson: No! Turn it off! It's too intense for me!
Milhouse Van Houten: Some guys just can't take crocodiles.
Kirk Van Houten: (NERVOUS) Is it over yet?
(RURAL AREA: ext. rural area - day)
Cletus Spuckler: And if you're dissatisfied for any reason, I will refund your money in the form of acorns.
Giuseppe: (DISGUSTED NOISES) This "gunpowder." It has a-crystal meth in it.
Cletus Spuckler: (ALARMED) Crystal meth? Then what the heck did I sell to them Colombian drug lords?!
Cletus Spuckler: Brandine! We're feudin' with the Escobars again!
Brandine Del Roy: Does that mean I ain't talkin' to Maria?!
Cletus Spuckler: (ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?) Duh. Yes.
Giuseppe: Homer, we will get the fireworks someplace else.
Brandine Del Roy: The pig's been eaten the C-4 blocks again!

Crowd: (HUGE APPLAUSE)
Sideshow Mel: Completely deserved!
Bart Simpson: Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Mel. But I am not here to talk about myself. Milhouse, would you join me at the podium?
Drederick Tatum: What's going on? Seriously, what, what's transpiring?
Bart Simpson: I've gotta set things straight. (TO CROWD) During that same race, my friend Milhouse was in the lead, when something horrible happened...
Lisa Simpson: Bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie, and that's exactly what he did.
Bart Simpson: (QUICKLY) Rather than try to figure out what happened, Milhouse had the courage to move on. To me, that's a hero.
Crowd: (APPRECIATIVE APPLAUSE)
Drederick Tatum: Nicely done. Now we will give out free rubber bracelets. Do not wear them to bed. They smell like truck tires. They're disgusting.
Kearney Zzyzwicz: Crotch or forehead?

Grampa Simpson: Well, there is a price. You wake up sweating in the middle of the night?
Bart Simpson: (ADMITTING) Yes.
Grampa Simpson: (SADLY) So do I. But I get back to sleep by counting the men I let down. There's Jerry, Izzy, Brooklyn, the O'Donnell boys, the lost ship: P.T.-108, the Poor Buggers of Meatloaf Ridge, the Andrew sisters... (STARTS TO SNORE)
Bart Simpson: I understand. You have standards.
Milhouse Van Houten: This is an angry sleepover. I'm only doin' it 'cause it was on the books.

Homer Simpson: It's a song? I thought we were just riffing.

Krusty the Clown: How can they say I'm past my prime? Me! The voice of Ovaltine! (SAD NOISE)
Bart Simpson: Krusty, why don't you talk to your Dad? He'll cheer you up. He's a Rabbi. He must've learned something from that giant star scroll he's always reading.
Krusty the Clown: Kid, does talking to your Dad make you feel better?
Bart Simpson: Well no... but he's not a rabbi. More of a Flabbi. (FLAB-EYE)

Krusty the Clown: Wha?
RABBIS: (BLASÉ) Eh. Eh. Eh. (ETC.)

Krusty the Clown: (EYES DARTING) Huh... you really notice stuff, don't you?

Krusty the Clown: I'm a sad, tragic clown like what's his name, Liberace.
Therapist: Tell me about your father, huh?
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Herschel! Did you read your Exodus?
TEENAGED KRUSTY: Oh, uh, oh, sure.
Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky: Really? Then tell me, what did the Burning Bush say?

CLIVE MERIWETHER: (ORSON WELLES) Krusty the Clown will perhaps best be remembered for taking up two spots in the Channel Six parking lot.
CLIVE MERIWETHER: (ORSON WELLES) On a personal level, he used to call me Little Lord Tingaling. I shan't miss that. This man's only lasting legacies are a law in his name limiting the working hours of chimpanzees to fourteen hours a day, and the invention of the payment of alimony by dropping hot pennies from a helicopter. I give his life a D-plus. Good day to you.
Kent Brockman: What will Krusty do now? I suppose only time will tell. Which is true for all news stories, I guess. Until anyone realizes, I'm Kent Brockman adding no useful information. And here's another sentence. (WINDING IT UP) You can tell I'm winding it up because my voice is (GOES UP) going up (GOES DOWN) and down (WITH FINALITY) like this.

Bart Simpson: Hey, Krusty.
Krusty the Clown: What? Have you been going to temple?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. And I've learned that all religions are equally boring. But there's a reason I went. Come and see.
Krusty the Clown: Kid, there's no way you can cheer me up. Not when whiskey, good deeds and hookers failed.

Lisa Simpson: I've got an idea... but I'll need that broccoli.
Lisa Simpson: These two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same. One of them, however, has the broccoli blended in.
Lisa Simpson: Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end.
Homer Simpson: Uh, works for me.
Bart Simpson: I'm in.

ORIGINAL GHOST MARGE: Choose me because I'm not bitter yet, I can stay up later, and you're on my mind all the time.
REGULAR GHOST HOMER: (INTRIGUED NOISE) Marge number two, how would you win my whoopee?
REGULAR GHOST MARGE: Those are great reasons, but there's one reason you should choose me. Because I know everything that you've done, (SWEETLY) and yet I still want to be with you.
ORIGINAL GHOST MARGE: (SMALL SOB) That is so beautiful.
REGULAR GHOST HOMER: (TO REGULAR GHOST MARGE) You're right Marge, I could never leave you. Not even for you. If there was a dot or a squiggle different, that would be too much.
REGULAR GHOST MARGE/ ORIGINAL GHOST MARGE: (TOUCHED) Oh Homie! / Oh Homie!
ORIGINAL GHOST BART: Time to cut the treacle, man.

Homer Simpson: (SUSPICIOUS) Wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. What's going on?

Homer Simpson: No, Marge... no! You can't invite a couple of Riddlers to stay in the Bat Cave!
Marge Simpson: You ate the food and looked in the mirrors! They're staying.
Homer Simpson: Hm, oh honey, one teensy problem with this plan. I'm a teensy bit concerned about them smoking around the children. You know, their lungs are so teensy.
Marge Simpson: (CONCERNED NOISE) He has a point...
Selma Bouvier: No, no, no, no. We don't have to smoke!
Patty Bouvier: We can stop whenever we want! See?
Selma Bouvier: (STARTLED NOISE)
Selma Bouvier: Okay, how about this: if you catch us smoking in the house even one time, you can throw us out on the street. Hm?
Marge Simpson: You know what? I trust them not to smoke.
Homer Simpson: And if you trust them, I trust them too.
Homer Simpson: (EVIL CHUCKLE) Safety first.

Patty Bouvier: Choke on our harmless fumes.
Homer Simpson: If you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?
Selma Bouvier: Mmm-mmmm.
Homer Simpson: (SAD MOAN)
Patty Bouvier: They call these cigarettes? They don't stain my fingers, my hair smells like hair, and what do I stub out in my scrambled eggs?
Selma Bouvier: Sure, it's got the nicotine... but where's the tar? Where's the stab from every breath that reminds me I'm alive?
Patty Bouvier: No smoke detector! Let's roll!
Patty Bouvier: Wait, wait. Turn on the faucet so no one'll get suspicious.
Homer Simpson: Ha! I gotcha!
Homer Simpson: You can't resist smoking in the house any more than I can resist drinking in the car.
Marge Simpson: What happened?
Selma Bouvier: I don't know. The water caught on fire!

MAXINE LOMBARD: What makes men like you think you can do whatever you want to our planet?
C. Montgomery Burns: Maybe the planet wants a strong man to take her by the hand and lead her!
MAXINE LOMBARD: You don't know what the planet wants.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, and I suppose you do?
MAXINE LOMBARD: The planet wants to be protected and nourished, and maybe even...

(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: EXT. NUCLEAR PLANT - ESTABLISHING)
C. Montgomery Burns: If I want to resume fracking...

C. Montgomery Burns: Congratulations Simpson. You're now my Chief Energy Innovation Marketing Officer.
Homer Simpson: (NO CLUE WHAT THIS MEANS) Woo-hoo!
C. Montgomery Burns: All you've got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors.
Homer Simpson: (WORRIED) Woo-hoo? I don't know... "Fracking" is one of those scary Lisa words.
C. Montgomery Burns: Bah! Fracking produces enough clean natural gas to make America independent of sheikhs, caliphs and... Scandinavians. Not to mention it doesn't create any of that awful worker-mutating nuclear waste.
MUTANT CHARLIE: Homer, game starts in an hour. Don't forget to set your fantasy lineup.
Homer Simpson: (CASUAL) Thanks, Charlie. (THEN, TO MR. BURNS, INSPIRED) Maybe fracking isn't so bad.

Bender: (STICKING OUT TONGUE NOISE)
Professor Jonathan Frink: (ADMITTING) No, no they cannot. Not sure why they'd want to... (FRINK NOISE)
Professor Jonathan Frink: Now why are you here? What is your mission, uh, so-to-speak.
Bender: I don't remember.
Bender: Man, this guy doesn't ask permission. He just goes right in ya.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Aha! Bender's mission protocol is definitely intact. It just requires a delicate procedure known as "unplug and replug." (LAUGHS)
Professor Jonathan Frink: Because that fixes everything.
Bender: I remember why I'm here! To kill Homer Simpson!
Homer Simpson: (CUTESY) My ears are burning.
Bender: Not yet, but they will be.
Homer Simpson: (SCARED SCREAM) A boxing glove!
Homer Simpson: (SMALL, SAD) But we bowled together.
Bender: (SIGHS) I can't do it.
Lisa Simpson: What stopped you, Bender? Asimov's three laws of robotics?
Bender: You think robots care what some hack science fiction writer thinks? I killed Isaac Asimov on the way over here. Well, Isaac somebody.
Bender: What the?! My ass is about to project something.
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO) You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog.
LEELA: Bender, we've just regained contact. Have you killed Homer Simpson?
Bender: Uh... yep. Killed him good.
LEELA: If Homer's dead, why are the creatures he begat still here and multiplying out of control?
Homer Simpson: What the?
LEELA: (AGGRAVATED) You lied to me, Bender! Homer Simpson's still alive!
FRY: Come on, Bender. (MIMES STABBING) Stabbity-stabbity!
Lisa Simpson: Wait, stop! Why must you kill my Dad? Especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you?
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Homer Simpson must be eliminated immediately! The creatures destroying New New York have his D.N.A.!
HERMES: The monsters are stealing our office supplies!
Bender: That's inexcusable!
Bender: (EMBARRASSED) Um...
DR. ZOIDBERG: Hello, robut! Looks like everyone gets a turn to say something! This concludes my turn.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: We sent Bender back in time to kill Homer before the monsters could evolve from him. Apparently this was too heartless a task for a robot. Leela, can you handle it?
LEELA: In a New, New York minute, minute!
FRY/PROFESSOR/LEELA: (PAINED GRUNTS) Ow!
Bender: (CHUCKLES)
Bender: Ow! Right in my langwich centard! (INCOMPREHENSIBLE LANGUAGE-FAILING NOISES)
Professor Jonathan Frink: Professor, you-you're a fellow man of science. Maybe if we teamed up, we could uh figure something out.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: (TO FRINK) Okay, but remember, to me you're incredibly stupid.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Oh, and the annoying girl may be helpful. Meanwhile, Leela, take Homer and explore this time period. Find out why people would ever pay for "freemium games."
Homer Simpson: I'll explain. Okay, it starts free, right?
(Springfield Street: Ext. Springfield street - a little later)
Homer Simpson: Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion...
Krusty the Clown: Get a load of those freaks.

Homer Simpson: And that's why I owe Clash of Candies twenty thousand dollars. Here we are.

Lisa Simpson: Professor Farnsworth, I'm dying to know how you got here. Was it a time machine?
Lisa Simpson: (SNAPS FINGERS) That's it! All we have to do is dig up the time capsule!
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Little girl, time machines are physical impossibilities. We teleported through a singularity that I quantum entangled to Bender under the guise of fixing his collar.
Professor Jonathan Frink: But how did Bender get here?
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: With a time machine.
Lisa Simpson: But you just said that--
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: (CUTTING HER OFF) Sample's ready!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - day)
Bender: (SNORES) Kill all humans... (SNORES) kill all humans...
Homer Simpson: (SNORES) Start with Flanders... (SNORES) start with Flanders...
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Good news, everyone!
FRY: That means it's bad.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: The human D.N.A. in the creatures was only half Homer's! The other half came from... someone else!
Professor Jonathan Frink: Oh, so we can kill that person instead. Maybe they're evil and deserve it. Or have one of those annoying voi-ces that gets on everybody's nerves! With the adding extra noises for no reason bloing... bloing.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: And the other person is...
Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED) Who is that?!
MARGE *: It's me!
Homer Simpson: (SURPRISED GASP)
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: (REALIZING) Wait a minute, we don't have to kill you.
Marge Simpson: Well that's better.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: We just have to kill all your children.
Marge Simpson: (SCARED YELP)
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Or just one of them, if you can figure out which one sired the killer rabbits.

Lisa Simpson: (NOT SURPRISED) What a surprise -- it's Bart.
Bart Simpson: Wow, I'm doing the same jokes a thousand years later. Ay carumba!
Professor Jonathan Frink: But how did a mere boy destroy the future?
Bart Simpson: Well...
Bart Simpson: Let this be a lesson: never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.
LEELA: And bury Bart in the hole!
Marge Simpson: I thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love. Like in Epcot Center.
LEELA: In our time, Epcot Center is a work farm for the weak.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Oh, but it's not as crowded as the slave labor camps at Universal Studios.

Homer Simpson: Ha! February has no twenty-third! (CHOKES BART HARDER)
Marge Simpson: Yes it does!
Marge Simpson: Can you please just get us out of this lousy future?
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Actually, of all probable futures, this is the worst.
Marge Simpson: It is, 'cause my baby's not in it!
Lou: Well why are you dressed in your uniform, then?
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Motherly love. Why did we outlaw that? Madam, our mechanical friend Bender is your portal home. But we can't use him until the generator is repaired.
Marge Simpson: Homer works at a nuclear plant! He can help us get home!
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Oh, are you good at your job?
Homer Simpson: I was voted Employee of the Month as an April Fool's Day joke. (DECAPITATING) Why you little... why you little...
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Great. You and Fry can bumble around together while the rest of us give up and make peace with our various deities. As for me, I'm an atheist.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: Oh Nobody's Father who art nowhere, I know you can't hear me, completely ignore this prayer. Nothing art thou, and Nothing will thou ever be. Jesus was just, A Man.
Bender: (REPEATING) A Man.
HEDONISMBOT: Well, I shall stay here for the decadence. There's no debauchery like end-of-the-world debauchery!

Lisa Simpson: I can't believe you're all giving up without a fight.
LEELA: Lisa, we're just a package delivery service.
FRY: And not a very good one.
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH: The only way to handle the creatures is to do what we do to each year's Super Bowl losers -- shoot them into space. But we'd have to round them up first.
Lisa Simpson: (POINTED) Let me take care of that. If there's one thing I know how to do, it's manipulate Barts.

Marge Simpson: You sound great! Your licks are really... juicy.
Homer Simpson: They're not juicy. My licks are dry. Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.
Marge Simpson: You didn't join a band to become famous like in "Almost Famous." You loved playing music with your friends. That was enough to make you happy.
Homer Simpson: Well it's not enough anymore. When something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. Look it up, it's called physics.
Marge Simpson: Apu is a good man. He sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the Costington Center.

Alien Woman: (ANGRY) Silence! (GENTLE) Homer, we will get you back to Earth.
Homer Simpson: What about my family?
ALIEN MAN: Why do you care? It's just your sex mate and spermlings.
Homer Simpson: Sex mate? Clearly you've never been married. But it's great, I'm telling you.
(FLYING SAUCER: int. flying saucer - continuous)
Alien Woman: (FLIRTY) Unfortunately, we only had the means to build the spaceship for one. We spent most of our money on the party.
Homer Simpson: Well, it is a great party.
Alien Woman: The pod is equipped to fulfill your deepest desires. Just concentrate.
Homer Simpson: Suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting.
Homer Simpson: What the?!
Homer Simpson: Oh who am I kidding? I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. I'm going back to save them.
Alien Woman: Aww. If I could just live inside that head, so full of noble thoughts.
Kang: The golden rule states if the chosen one escapes, his family is eaten as forfeit.
HOMER): (DRAMATIC) What do your rules say now?
Kang: That all will be eaten!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Lisa Simpson: This system is really rigged against us.
Bart Simpson: (SAD MOAN)
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED GROAN)
Homer Simpson: You forgot to glaze me!
Kodos: No I didn't! You licked it off!
Homer Simpson: I think somebody's afraid to admit he's out of glaze.
Kodos: (GRUMPY NOISE)
Homer Simpson: Glaze, please.
Kodos: (FURIOUS NOISE)
Kang: Make way for the queen!
Queen Elizabeth II: (DAME JUDI DENCH VOICE) I shall take the first bite. It is quite an honor.
Homer Simpson: (CONCERNED) What's that?
Kang: Part of your magnificent behind. We sliced it off when you were sleeping.
Homer Simpson: It does look delicious.
Kodos: (HORRIFIED) What is it, my queen?
Queen Elizabeth II: This ass is most disagreeable. (DISGUSTED NOISE)
INTELLECTUAL ALIEN: The creatures are composed of completely indigestible toxins!
INTELLECTUAL ALIEN: These humans have been poisoned by their unhealthy fast-food diet.
Lisa Simpson: Um, are you sure you don't want to try me again?
Kang: You?! Your lunches of hummus and rice cakes combine in your stomach to form formaldehyde and animal fat.
Lisa Simpson: Really? But I thought...
Kodos: You'd be better off chewing tobacco like the boy.
Marge Simpson: What?!
Bart Simpson: Dad said I could try it.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Don't you people realize your queen is dying?
INTELLECTUAL ALIEN: I'm afraid the lardo speaks the truth, Your Majesty.
Queen Elizabeth II: It's all right. I have seen many glories and have only one regret: that my breasts aren't bigger.
Bart Simpson: I don't see any breasts.
Queen Elizabeth II: And those will be the last words I ever hear. (DIES)
Kodos: Useless humans! We will send you back to your planet, and your memories will fade. (TURNS TO CAMERA) So it will be as if none of this ever happened. (EYE DARTS)
(Spaceship: Int. spaceship - a while later)
Homer Simpson: Captain's log, Star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. After successfully conquering the Rigelians...
Lisa Simpson: Right. Conquering.
Bart Simpson: At least Maggie can fly us home.
Marge Simpson: Thank God it's just like her busy box.
Homer Simpson: (SCARED NOISE) I have such a big ass.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - night - establishing)
Lisa Simpson: Well, I guess we've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe, we have evolved into the most inedible species. Like three bean salad at a barbecue, we will remain untouched.
Marge Simpson: We're receiving a transmission from an unknown source!
Grampa Simpson: (ANGRY) Hey, I finally tracked you down! My oatmeal's gone cold!
Grampa Simpson: The cat ate my heart medicine!

DON BOOKNER: Yep. It's time for the gold watch.
C. Montgomery Burns: Thank you. You are free to go.
Carl Carlson: Good ol' Don.
Homer Simpson: We sure will miss your, your, um, uh -- what'd you do again?
DON BOOKNER: Safety Inspector. 7-G.
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED NOISE) But, wait a minute! That's my job!
DON BOOKNER: Yes. Of course it is. There are two of us, and I've been covering for you all these years.
Homer Simpson: (STUNNED) That would explain a lot. But why did you do it?
DON BOOKNER: I felt there was something special in you. It's like rooting for the Cubs. You keep thinking they'll make it and then you realize they never, ever will.
DON BOOKNER: (TO HOMER) But now you won't have me to protect you.
Homer Simpson: No, please! All I'm asking you to do is stay twenty-one more years!
DON BOOKNER: Too late. I'm gone. If I was Fred Flintstone I'd be at the end of the dinosaur's tail.
Lenny Leonard: (SINGS) FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW...
Smitty: (SINGS) FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW...
Carl Carlson: (SINGS) FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOOOW!
DON BOOKNER: (SINGS) WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY. (SOTTO) Last time I'm covering your ass, Homer.
Marge Simpson: (YAWNS) How was your day?
Homer Simpson: (UPSET) Stressful. Do you see how loose my tie is?
Marge Simpson: (VERY ALARMED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: For the first time I actually had to do my job.
Marge Simpson: (MOVED) Oh, sweetie... (HUGS HIM)
Homer Simpson: (MOAN) And Marge, I've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. A little sour and a little sick.
Marge Simpson: There's a Yiddish word for it: "shpilkes."
Homer Simpson: They have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Int. Power plant - day)
Lenny Leonard: Hey, Homer. Carl and I are gonna see if we can sneak out of the men's room without setting off the automatic toilets, ninja-style.
Homer Simpson: Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!
Waylon Smithers: (WALKS UP) Simpson! I want a full plant status report at five o'clock.
Homer Simpson: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Can I get a four fifty-five wakeup call?
Waylon Smithers: No. (EXITS)
Homer Simpson: (SAD MOAN)
Lenny Leonard: Dammit.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - the next morning)
Lisa Simpson: I thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.
Homer Simpson: (AGGRAVATED) It's called a double standard. One of the bedrocks of parenting.
Marge Simpson: You've been working so hard lately. Maybe you should take a break.
Homer Simpson: No. Marge, if I lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. Oh, I guess, as a fallback, I could direct films like Angelina Jolie. How many properties do we have an option on?
Marge Simpson: None.
Homer Simpson: What?! (ACCUSING) When were you gonna tell me?
Marge Simpson: (STARTLED NOISE)
Homer Simpson: When?!
Marge Simpson: Homie... workaholic is probably your best "aholic" ever, but you need to relax...so I got us all tickets to see the circus on Saturday.
Homer Simpson: The circus? (REMOVES GLASSES) Hmmm, I haven't been to the circus since I was a kid.
Bart Simpson: Is that true?
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Okay, Marge. We can go to the circus. Maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion.
(CIRCUS WITH MIDWAY: ext. circus with midway - establishing)
(Circus Tent: int. circus tent - day)
Homer Simpson: Dammit! This circus Wi-Fi is a joke!
Marge Simpson: I thought you were going to try to relax.
Homer Simpson: How can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?
Lisa Simpson: I knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking.
Homer Simpson: What kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
Homer Simpson: The early bird gets the shaft!
CIRCUS AUDIENCE: Shhh!
Homer Simpson: (TO MARGE) Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.
Homer Simpson: 'Scuse me, pardon me, what the Hell?
Homer Simpson: Oh! Finally! The business call I've been waiting for! Hello, this is--
Homer Simpson: (GETTING SQUIRT NOISES)

Homer Simpson: Eh, they'll grow back.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I have to use the (LOUD WHISPER) Porta Potty.
Homer Simpson: Oh for God's-- now? Do you have to?
Marge Simpson: No woman uses one of these by choice.
Bart Simpson: Hey Dad, since we've gotta wait, can't we please see an act?
Homer Simpson: (SIGHS) Fine. (NOT THRILLED) But I'll be amazed if I'm astounded.
(HYPNOTIST TENT: int. hypnotist tent - continuous)
Cletus Spuckler: (HYPNOTIZED, ERUDITE) ...thereby proving Zorn's lemma.
Brandine Del Roy: (STORMS UP) Give me my damn husband back!

SVEN-GOLLY: (THEATRICAL) I need a new volunteer. (TO HOMER) How about you, sir?
Homer Simpson: (AGHAST) Hey, is that time right? I have a deadline in an hour and a half!
Lisa Simpson: You know, Dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient.
Homer Simpson: (A LITTLE RELUCTANT) Okay.
Lisa Simpson: (SHRUGS) I just wanted to see him cluck like a chicken. (CHUCKLES)
SVEN-GOLLY: Now we've never met, have we, sir?
Homer Simpson: Ooh, patter!
SVEN-GOLLY: Do you have any children?
Homer Simpson: No, but we're having fun trying. (LAUGHS) Wait, I mean three.
SVEN-GOLLY: When I snap my fingers you shall be (MEANINGFUL) ten years old.
Homer Simpson: Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked. Did you hear me? Stack...
SVEN-GOLLY: You are ten years old.

SVEN-GOLLY: (DRAMATIC) Only a ten-year-old boy could be this annoying!
Audience: (VERY IMPRESSED NOISES)
Bart Simpson: (ARMS FOLDED) I'm not convinced.
Homer Simpson: (10-YEAR-OLD TO BART) I know you are but what am I, infinity plus one! Jinx!
Bart Simpson: Only the coolest kid ever could think of that! Good golly, Sven-Golly! You did it!
Chief Wiggum: Sven-Golly, born Svenjamin Golly, you are under arrest for mesmerizing the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to induct Kiss.
Chief Wiggum: (GETTING HYPNOTIZED) ...you are wanted by the police, by which I mean Sting... Andy Summers... and... hey is it-- is it getting hot in here?
Lou: Oh, not again.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, Dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten!

Dr. Julius Hibbert: Now I'm gonna test just how deeply Homer's mind has been affected. (OFFERS PAPER CUP) Take a sip of this, young man.
Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE, COUGHS, THEN SPITS IT OUT) Ew! Gross!
Marge Simpson: What did you give him?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (DRAMATIC) Beer.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: This hypnotism is strong. Dinner theater strong!
Marge Simpson: My husband can't really think he's ten.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (GRIM) I'm saying he so desperately needs to believe he's ten, that only the original hypnotist who did this can undo the trance without risking permanent damage to Homer's psyche. (CHUCKLES)
Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE, CHOKING) Help... help me.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (NOT SOTTO) Dear God!
Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE) Psych!
Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE, A LITTLE PHONY) Oops.
Marge Simpson: So what do we do?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Do not force the truth. For now, treat Homer just as you would a regular ten-year-old boy.
Bart Simpson: Can he be nine so I can beat him up?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Oh, I'm afraid not. The rules of hypnotism are inflexible.
Bart Simpson: Then can we get pizza on the way home?
Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE) Ask for boogers on Bart's half!
Bart Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Good one.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (GRIM) Booger pizza. You better pray they find that hypnotist, Marge.

Milhouse Van Houten: Guess I chose the wrong day to wear culottes.
Bart Simpson: Every day's the wrong day to wear culottes. (TAGS MILHOUSE) You're "it"!
Homer Simpson: (WALKS UP ACTING 10 VOICE) Can I play?
Bart Simpson: (TO SELF) Oh, God, no.
Nelson Muntz: If Milhouse can play, anyone can play!
Milhouse Van Houten: (HAPPILY) Once again I'm the lower bound! You're it!
Gary Chalmers: Is that a grown man going between the children's legs?
Seymour Skinner: There's nothing in the rule book against it.
Gary Chalmers: It's on page one of the rule book!
Seymour Skinner: That's where I doodle.
Seymour Skinner: It's a comic strip I do called "Bumble and Grumble." Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.

Bart Simpson: Hey, would you ever wanna have a real job and a family?
Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE) Pff. Wife? Three kids? Steady job? If I did, I'd secretly be very sad. You could tell by how much I would eat and drink and just sit on the couch.
Bart Simpson: (HUGE GASP)
Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE) Yeah. Thank God that never happened.
Bart Simpson: Wow. He doesn't want to be my Dad. He just wants to be a kid like me. Almost makes me not wanna prank him. Almost.

Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE) Change back to what?
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) Look in the lake. Tell me what you see.
Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE) Bloated corpse under the water. I'd say he's been there a few months at least. Interesting the way his lips move just like mine. Why do you ask?

Bart Simpson: (DRAMATIC) Or isn't there not?
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LATER)

Homer Simpson: (ACTING 10 VOICE) Bye, Bart. Stay ten forever.
Bart Simpson: Goodbye, friend.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Before you fix him... can you change one little thing? (WHISPERS) I'm embarrassed to ask this, but after we... snuggle, he always rolls over and goes to sleep and I'd rather... (MORE WHISPERED)
SVEN-GOLLY: (SARCASTIC) That's the only thing you want changed? Everything else about him is perfect?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
SVEN-GOLLY: Where were you when I was straight? All right, let's do this.
SVEN-GOLLY: (CLAPPING HANDS) You are back!
Homer Simpson: (STRESSED-OUT ADULT) - parked! I hate stack parking! Wait! Where am I? This isn't the circus! It's an amusement park! The furthest thing from a circus!
Marge Simpson: Well, here's what happened...

Lisa Simpson: No! Let's take the eagle to Shelbyville Animal Rescue. Where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.
Homer Simpson: Um...
Lisa Simpson: Or, maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild.
Homer Simpson: Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. (VERY ENTHUSED) Insanely, unbelievably great!
Bart Simpson: Squawky?

ELON MUSK: I'm... I'm not that guy.
Lisa Simpson: His company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! He changed the way Hollywood drives!
Homer Simpson: (PROUD) And now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg.
Mailman: (THRILLED) Honey! Guess who crushed me? I'll give you a hint... his first name is Elon. (NODS HAPPILY) That's right!
(Simpson Home: Int. Simpson house - KITCHEN - later)
Marge Simpson: So what brings you to Springfield, Mr. Musk?
C. Montgomery Burns: Of course.
ELON MUSK: What did bring me to Springfield? Well, to start with, I'm an idea man. It's my raison d'être.
Homer Simpson: Mmm, raisin detra.
ELON MUSK: I've hit a dry patch. I'm blocked.
ELON MUSK: In my personal drought, I'm traveling the country, quietly by spaceship, looking for... inspiration.
Lisa Simpson: That's so sad. Maybe we're the same, two lost ships in the intellectual sea, each of whom could inspire the other to...
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Hey Elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where I work tomorrow.
ELON: (ENTHUSED) I am! And I will!
Homer Simpson: Great. And if anyone asks where I am, just cover for me.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Fine. We'll both go. And if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, "protons."
(Homer's Car: Int. HOMER'S CAR - morning)
Homer Simpson: So do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?
ELON MUSK: Homer, if we're gonna carpool together, there's one thing you have to know.
Homer Simpson: "Ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free." It's as old as the Bible.
ELON MUSK: No, it's that I don't talk to anyone unless they provide the mental stimulation I seek.
Homer Simpson: Ditto.
Lisa Simpson: (SMALL LAUGH) Hi, I didn't want to miss one more chance to spend time with Mr. Musk. (TURNS TO MUSK) It is such an honor.
Lisa Simpson: He is. And may I save that paper?
Lisa Simpson: No ideas? Oh, that's sad.
Lisa Simpson: That's even worse!
Lisa Simpson: (HORRIFIED GASP)
Homer Simpson: Aw, man, I wish those were white meatballs.
ELON MUSK: Oh wow! That's an idea! White meatballs. Synthetic meat that you can print from your printer. Say something else. Please, now!
Homer Simpson: Uh... don't tase me, bro. Chocolate rain!
ELON MUSK: Tase... bro... chocolate rain. Use electroplating to remove metal ions from rainwater, making it suitable for drinking!
Homer Simpson: What about the chocolate?
ELON MUSK: We'll make the device a soothing chocolate color. Brilliant!
ELON MUSK: Pittsburgh Steel... Dallas cowboys... robotic cattle herding! Thank you, Homer.
Lisa Simpson: He's taking your Homer-isms and turning them into his own great ideas! This is the most inspirational moment of my life, but, unfortunately, this is my stop.
Lisa Simpson: Bye!
ELON MUSK: Well, come on, keep throwing things at me.
Homer Simpson: Um...
ELON MUSK: Oh! This is a break! We're-- we're taking a break!
Homer Simpson: I gotcha!
ELON MUSK: You're fun!
Homer Simpson: Well duh!
Chief Wiggum: Why don't we have fun like that, Lou?
Chief Wiggum: (PANICKED NOISES)
Lou: (PAINED NOISE) Chief, did anyone ever tell you there's a safety on that gun?
Chief Wiggum: You mean this thing?
Lou: That's the trigger.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: ext. Nuclear plant - establishing - day)
(PLANT: Int. plant - continuous)
ELON MUSK: What are you writing? Share, buddy.
Homer Simpson: Suggestion for the "suggestion box."
ELON MUSK: Can anyone make a suggestion?
Homer Simpson: Be my guest, but I seriously doubt the old man ever reads 'em.
(Burns's Office: int. burns' office - a little later)
C. Montgomery Burns: (WRITING) Suggestion eight thousand, four thirty-two: Nix!
C. Montgomery Burns: Technically an order...not a suggestion.
C. Montgomery Burns: "Installing an M.H.D. Generator would allow the plant to operate at a higher temperature without the tyranny of moving parts. Using conducting plasma as the moving conductor..."
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent! Clearly the work of Lenny. That's the white one, right?
(PLANT: Int. plant - a little Later)
Waylon Smithers: Is this your suggestion?
Lenny Leonard: No, no. Mine was rubber mats in the decontamination showers. Also, water in the decontamination showers!
C. Montgomery Burns: Never!
Waylon Smithers: Good Lord! Sir, you know who that is. The man who's revolutionized the car industry.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO MUSK) Henry Ford! Good to see you. As healthy and vibrant as Detroit itself.
Waylon Smithers: No, sir. (GESTURES) This is Elon Musk. For some reason he's sharing a console with Homer Simpson.
ELON MUSK: His mind is as rich as an Italian wedding soup. Homer! What are you thinking now?
ELON MUSK: Sorry, that's something I'm working on so that I don't have to display facial expressions.
C. Montgomery Burns: Young man, I look at you and I see myself.
C. Montgomery Burns: How much would you charge to work for me?
ELON MUSK: I don't care about the money. The whole monetary system is just a series of interconnected heterogeneous data bases.
C. Montgomery Burns: Could you... repeat that first part?
ELON MUSK: I don't care about the money?
C. Montgomery Burns: (ENTHUSED) Once more, with feeling!
ELON MUSK: I don't care about the money!
C. Montgomery Burns: Now, let me feel the vibrations of your lips!
ELON MUSK: (BURNS PUTS HIS FINGERS ON HIS LIPS) I-don't-care-about-the-money. And-I-want-you-to-get-your-fingers-out-of-my-mouth.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, there's something strange in his mouth.
Waylon Smithers: It's called moisture.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hm, I see.
C. Montgomery Burns: Okay, Musk. What do you propose?
ELON MUSK: Well, you'll need to increase the capacity of your plant. You cover the costs, you get a hundred percent of the profits.
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO) Careful, Elon. He's not as kindly as he appears.
ELON MUSK: Now, Burns, what if everything in town not powered by electricity were powered by electricity. The electricity you sell them. Imagine that.
C. Montgomery Burns: (VERY EXCITED, BREATHES HEAVILY, THEN:) My doctor says I'm not allowed to imagine. So I hired someone to do it for me.
Waylon Smithers: (INTO RADIO) Send in the imaginer.
IMAGINER: (EXUBERANT) Oh, that's fabulous! Oh, my goodness. I can see everything!
C. Montgomery Burns: (IMPRESSED) I'm in!
IMAGINER: Oh, by the way, Mr. Burns, I haven't been paid in a while.
C. Montgomery Burns: Here you go. Imagine.
IMAGINER: Ooh, Swiss francs! Time to take my wife for a night on the town!
IMAGINER: (REALIZING HE'S BEEN HAD) Hey wait a minute!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Ext. Nuclear plant - cooling towers - day - lunchtime)
Homer Simpson: So... what kind of lunch do you pack?
Homer Simpson: Wow. Elon, you're like Willie Wonka without the underpaid munchkins.
Homer Simpson: Uh, I'd like to offer you something... but all I've got is coffee... with cream!
Homer Simpson: Come on, I want cream! Give it up! (STRUGGLES, THEN ANNOYED GRUNT) cream and sugar are one thing too many!
ELON MUSK: (INSPIRED) Exactly! Exactly! What if we make the cream cup out of sugar so it dissolves in the coffee?
Homer Simpson: Wow. Wow. Between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team. Come on, give me a hug.
ELON MUSK: Sorry, I'm not one for hugging.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm not one for just talking.
Homer Simpson: Does that drone do date nights with the wife?
(Springfield Town Square: ext. TOWN SQUARE - day)
ELON MUSK: My partner, Montgomery Burns...
Crowd: (THUNDEROUS BOOS)
ELON MUSK: ...and I...
Benjamin: (NERDY CHEER)
ELON MUSK: ...have exciting news. Springfield Nuclear has electric solutions to all of your energy needs. The Springfield Hyperloop...electrifying the school to replace the old power source -- Willie pushing a wheel...
(Springfield Elementary School Basement: int. school basement - continuous)
ELON MUSK: ...and my passion project, the Glayvinator!
Professor Jonathan Frink: (STUNNED) You -- you have a Glayvinator too?! Is it... um... uh... patent pending?
ELON MUSK: Patent granted!
Professor Jonathan Frink: (SADLY) All the years of glayvinning in my basement for naught! I'm a failure.
ELON MUSK: (SYMPATHETIC) Ah yes, everyone's been there.
Professor Jonathan Frink: (BRIGHTENING) You have those feelings too!
ELON MUSK: Of course not.
Professor Jonathan Frink: (ANGRY) If I knew how to make a fist I'd hit you!
C. Montgomery Burns: This is wonderful, Smithers. For once in my life something's going my way.
Waylon Smithers: I'm not so sure.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SARCASTIC) Oh, another visit from Mr. Worrywart.
Waylon Smithers: I don't trust Musk. Anyone with that much money has a darkness in his soul.
C. Montgomery Burns: Says you!
(Smithers's Apartment: Int. smithers' apartment - night)
(Burns Manor: Int. Burns' mansion - night)
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns... Mr. Burns...
ELON MUSK: ...assuming a linear growth model...
Waylon Smithers: Sir, Musk's ideas sound great. Too great. We're meant for wretched lives. We should pass on this. And before you reply, remember: I've never let you down.
C. Montgomery Burns: You know what I'm going to say, right?
Waylon Smithers: Release the...
C. Montgomery Burns: I was going to say "get out," but your idea sounds better.
Waylon Smithers: (SIGHS) Can you give me a ten second head start?
C. Montgomery Burns: Of course.
C. Montgomery Burns: (QUICKLY) One, two, three!
C. Montgomery Burns: Not on my carpet!
Kent Brockman: (UPBEAT) Attention fans of "The Little Rascals": (GRIM) the last of them died today in Palm Springs. Now it's time for traffic with Arnie Pye.
Arnie Pye: Nothing to report, Kent. Since Elon Musk gave everyone self-driving cars, there hasn't been a single accident.
Kent Brockman: Well, you be careful up there, Arnie.
Arnie Pye: No need! Mr. Musk gave me a self-flying chopper!
Arnie Pye: Where's Arnie? Now I can get as loaded as I want. Which is pretty damn loaded!
Arnie Pye: Oh boy! (SINGS TO "TWINKLE LITTLE STAR") ELON, ELON YOU'RE MY GUY

(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: ext. nuclear plant - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Welcome, friends. I've invited you here to share in our first quarterly profit report. I'm sure you're all eager to hear how much richer I am. Now, to end the suspense: Elon?
ELON MUSK: Thank you, Monty. At our current rate...
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes.
ELON MUSK: ...we are losing roughly fifty million dollars a quarter.
ELON MUSK: Just remember, our purpose is to show the planet how to save itself...
C. Montgomery Burns: (FRIENDLY) Oh, the planet. I adore the planet. And do you know my favorite part of the planet? (FURIOUS) Gravity!
ELON MUSK: There are no trap doors on this podium, Burns. You just started the PowerPoint presentation.
C. Montgomery Burns: (GROWING HORROR) No, no, no! Musk, you tricked me!
ELON MUSK: Not a trick. We sacrifice now to take care of the future. In a way totally determined by me.
C. Montgomery Burns: (BITTER) Oh, all I wanted was to make obscene profits in the last year of my life and leave it to no one. Why does God hate dreamers?
C. Montgomery Burns: Due to recent fluctuations in my judgment, and the once-in-a-lifetime mistake of trusting another human being, I am saddened to announce massive layoffs.
Lenny Leonard: Who will pay for my radiation sickness treatments?
C. Montgomery Burns: Not my concern!
Carl Carlson: But Musk was our savior!
C. Montgomery Burns: Your so-called "savior" isn't interested in saving anything but the world. Bah!
(CHANNEL SIX NEWS DESK: INT. CHANNEL SIX NEWS DESK)

C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, the hounds feel terrible for what they did. And good news, one pooped out your ear! We'll dip it in iodine and it's just like new.
Waylon Smithers: (SMALL, SAD GROAN)
C. Montgomery Burns: Also, I'm sorry I couldn't find the records of the shots the hounds had, which in turn led to all those painful injections in your abdomen.
Waylon Smithers: (GROANS)
C. Montgomery Burns: Now, the reason I'm here.
C. Montgomery Burns: I've made the calls. I'm going to have Elon Musk killed. (GENTLY) And I'll give you a little extra morphine, friend.
Waylon Smithers: (DOPPLER FALLING NOISE)
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, right, that's a trap door.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpson house - night - establishing)
Homer Simpson: (SAD NOISE)
Marge Simpson: What's wrong Homer? Is it that all your friends are out of work and it's kind of your fault?
Homer Simpson: (DISMISSIVE) No. It's Elon. I don't care how much he likes me, I don't wanna be friends with him anymore. None of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out. Sky pies are lie pies! (SAD) Of all the planets in the universe, why did he have to come to this one?
Homer Simpson: How do you break up with a guy?
Marge Simpson: Here's what you do. You just take his hand, look in his eyes and say (FIRMLY) "I don't want to be with you anymore."
Homer Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Wow, you're good at that.
Marge Simpson: (PROUDLY) It's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships.
(Springfield: Ext. Springfield - power plant - day)
Waylon Smithers: Sir, I have my concerns about the team of hit men you've assembled. They seem a little... long in the tooth.

ELON MUSK: Whatever you want we'll make it work. Right, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Elon, Elon, Elon! I want to say something to you and I don't want you to be inspired by it. I want you to listen.
ELON MUSK: No!!!
Homer Simpson: I don't want to be with you anymore.
ELON MUSK: Can I ask why?
Homer Simpson: I could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that PayPal was my idea and I was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am I.
ELON MUSK: It's okay. I'll be fine.
Homer Simpson: It's on your face too!
Homer Simpson: Well, I've saved you one last prize from the Cracker Jack box that is my brain. Use it as you will.
Homer Simpson: On a Miami Dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.

YOUNG MOLEMAN: Springfielders, rejoice! What is the one thing our blessed little town has lacked?
C. Montgomery Burns: A human zoo?
YOUNG MOLEMAN: What we lack is a town anthem! And, you're in luck because I have written one! Mr. Largo, if you please.
Dewey Largo: Um-hm.
Moe Szyslak: (DRAMATIC) Stop the anthem!
Moe Szyslak: I was in Tuscaloosa on vacation. (HIDING RAGE) It started out great. They got a jernt there called Moe's Original Barbecue.

Mayor Joe Quimby: Wait a minute. (HOLDING UP THE OLD SONG SHEET) This song was supposedly written by... former Mayor Moleman!
Homer Simpson: I met a guy. A wonderful guy.
Hans Moleman: (BREAKING DOWN) I didn't write it! I bought it from a salesman who was selling it to half the towns in America. I didn't think you'd find out... because I never thought any of us would ever go anywhere.

Bart Simpson: Well, don't be so surprised, I did write that "Lisa, It's Your Birthday" song.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was Michael Jackson.
Bart Simpson: Whoa. Thinking back, I'm kinda surprised Mom and Dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom.
Homer Simpson: (PASSING BY) Simpler time.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I need your help to write a new anthem for Springfield. Will you team up with me?
Bart Simpson: Hmmm, what's in it for me?
Lisa Simpson: Uh, I'll make brownies later.

Homer Simpson: Marge, you're my wife of ten years and I love you. But I must observe the teachings of this man I just met tonight. Now, the first thing I have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale.
Homer Simpson: I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me.

C. Montgomery Burns: But I have a new scheme that will undo the terrible damage done by my other schemes. I have an appointment with a Nigerian King to negotiate a uranium deal that will put me right back on top.
Waylon Smithers: Nothing can stop you, sir.
Waylon Smithers: But... not that you're not at the top of your game... what if you don't get the deal?
C. Montgomery Burns: I'll just have to sell everything and move to the South Pacific with you. What a grim fate that would be.
Waiter: (TO BURNS) And with your omelet, would you like the fried potatoes or the mixed berries?
C. Montgomery Burns: I'll have the berries.
Waylon Smithers: (HOPEFUL GASP, THEN) A terrible fate indeed, sir.

Lisa Simpson: Dad, do you have anything I can eat?
Homer Simpson: (CAUGHT OFF GUARD NOISE)
Homer Simpson: Oh, uh, I will turn this corn chip into a wonderful meal, using my greatest skill -- lunchroom trading. Shut your eyes.
Carl Carlson: Pretty impressive, Homer.
Lenny Leonard: But what about the presentation? The eyes taste first, then lips, then palate, then the body's harshest critic, the colon.
Homer Simpson: Okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!
Lisa Simpson: (DELIGHTED GASP) Wow, Dad! (GIGGLES) Thank you!
(Burns's Office: Int. Burns' office - continuous)
C. Montgomery Burns: Welcome, your Majesty.
King: Mr. Burns, I don't know what you have heard, but I do not eat monkey brains from a skull.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, this is for me.
King: Before we begin, I have a favor to ask.
King: My daughter is traveling with me.
KEMI: Hello.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hm...
C. Montgomery Burns: (POINTS TO HOMER) That man is the perfect choice.
Waylon Smithers: What?! Sir, that's Homer Simpson. You forgot that he's the most incompetent...Homer Simpson would be perfect.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, all you have to do is babysit the Princess -- keeping her in this hotel room during the negotiations.
Homer Simpson: Babysitting, eh? What do I know about kids?
Homer Simpson: (HAWK NOISE) Princess, why did you put on that coat? You're obviously cold. May I escort you to the radiator?
KEMI: No. I want to go out. I am twenty-five years old.
Homer Simpson: Uh, just a second. (NONCHALANT) Hey, Marge. Yeah, I'm workin' late. Yep, special project.
Marge Simpson: Lenny said you were babysitting. And if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? I could use a night out.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Marge. (SNOOTY) But I am the royal babysitter. If I start watching commoners, the tongues of the court will be awag!
Marge Simpson: (VERY SARCASTIC) Really? Awag? Really? Well, if you think tha-- (CUT-OFF NOISE)
KEMI: I want to go out, and see the America whose greatest cities I've only seen destroyed in movies.
Homer Simpson: I see. You want excitement. Princess, have you ever heard of Studio Fifty-Four, C-B-G-Bs, the Roxbury?
KEMI: (EXCITED) Yes! I've dreamed of...
Homer Simpson: All gone. But in their place we have five hundred channels of television. All awesome. Sit down and I'll show you.

KEMI: I am from Africa.
Moe Szyslak: Wow, Africa. I had a good friend who really wanted to go there. So, uh, you speak English there?
KEMI: I speak five languages.
Moe Szyslak: (SNORTS) Nobody does.
KEMI: (PORTUGUESE) Eu não quero dizer para mostrar (FRENCH) Je ne veux pas montrer (SPANISH) No me refiero a presumir (JAPANESE) Watashi wa koji suru wakede wa arimasen
Moe Szyslak: Eh... which means what?
KEMI: I don't wish to show off.
Moe Szyslak: (CHUCKLES DESPITE HIMSELF) That's pretty good there, but don't expect me to bow and scrape. Well, I'll give you one scrape.
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, that's it, Majesty. Notice I didn't say "your."
KEMI: (GIGGLES) They don't make them like you in Nigeria.
Moe Szyslak: (STUNNED) Nigeria?
Moe Szyslak: (REPRESSED RAGE) Homer, can I speak to you in private?
Moe Szyslak: (FURIOUS NOISES)
Homer Simpson: Can I try it?
Moe Szyslak: Eh, you gotta be mad at something.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm mad I'm not doing it.
Homer Simpson: And you gave it to him?
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, I did. I was sure the guy was on the level because of his bad spelling and grammar.
Moe Szyslak: Now, guess how much of the twenty million I saw?
Homer Simpson: Eight million?
Moe Szyslak: Ze-ro.
Homer Simpson: Get outta here!
Moe Szyslak: (THEN) If Kemi there is a Nigerian princess, her brother just might be the Nigerian prince that took my money!
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) She's gone!
Moe Szyslak: And she trashed my bar! (LOOKS AROUND) Oh no, wait. She actually cleaned up a little. Good for her.
Homer Simpson: Chief! Thank God! I was drinking at Moe's, and I lost an African princess!
Chief Wiggum: Lost African princess, eh? Well, lucky for you, she just happens to be in the back of my cruiser.
Homer Simpson: Yes! The prayer I forgot to say has been answered.
Homer Simpson: (PUZZLED) What the?
Chief Wiggum: You're going straight to the drunk tank, rummy. (SNORTS) "African princess."
Gil Gunderson: Chief! I just saw someone robbin' the Kwik-E-Mart!
Chief Wiggum: Oh, now African Princesses are robbin' the Kwik-E-Mart, huh? Get in the car, booze bag.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Chief! I have been shot in the shoulder!
Chief Wiggum: In the car!
Chief Wiggum: What is this, Saint Patrick's Day?
Moe Szyslak: (MUMBLING) This is terrible. Can't think of anything to mumble to myself. That's how upset I am here.
KEMI: Also... maybe... I wanted to talk more to you.
Moe Szyslak: (PLEASED) Really?
Homer Simpson: (GETTING THROWN OUT NOISE)
Moe's Thoughts: (GRIMLY) Okay there, Moe. You gotta get to the brother, because he knows what my pin number is and I forgot.
Moe Szyslak: I see.
Moe's Thoughts: Now Moe, don't jump to conclusions. A lotta people have brothers.
Moe Szyslak: Does he have a computer?

(Springfield Police Station: Int. Springfield police station - night)
Homer Simpson: Guys, thanks for bailing me out. (VERY WORRIED) But I still have a huge problem.
Lenny Leonard: Well, till we find her, maybe we could get somebody to pretend to be her.
Lenny Leonard: You know, get a nice wig and a dress...
Carl Carlson: Oh no. I am not dressing up like an African Princess. I am not, I am not, I am not.
Carl Carlson: Thank you for listening to my objections.
Lenny Leonard: Well, you were really vehement.
Waylon Smithers: Uh, hello, Simpson. Just checking up. May I speak with the princess?
Homer Simpson: Um, yeah, sure. (FALSETTO) Hello, this is the princess. I'm with Homer Simpson and I do declare he's wonderful. Oh, that's right, I'm from South Africa. Fiddle dee dee.
Waylon Smithers: (CHUCKLES) Sounds like everything's going just the way I want it.
(Moe's Tavern: int. Moe's - continuous)
Moe Szyslak: Yeah, so all my money's tied up in this jernt. Can't even afford elocution lessons to teach me how to pronounce (OVER-PRONOUNCING) "joint." I guess I could do it online, but what's the pernt?
KEMI: (GIGGLES)
Moe Szyslak: What's so funny?
KEMI: I thought my English was perfect. But you make me feel even better about it.
Moe Szyslak: (LAUGHS) Usually people that tease me get thrown out on their ass. But, uh, your sayin' it made me feel good. Jeez, I sound like one of those guys in theM rom coms that play at the theater next to the theater I'm in.
Moe Szyslak: So, uh, what's a Princesses like you do all day, eh? A lot of spinning wheels and witches treatin' you like crap?
KEMI: I read. Are you familiar with the books by my countryman Chinua Achebe, "Things Fall Apart" and "No Longer At Ease?"
Moe Szyslak: You guys got real optimistic literature there.
KEMI: (AMUSED) Fair comment.
KEMI: (YAWNS) I haven't eaten all day.
Moe Szyslak: Don't eat those eggs! We don't know what kinda bird they turn into! But there's a string cheese or something in the fridge in the back. Help yourself.
Moe Szyslak: Alright, after she eats, I'd better close up. (STRETCHES, YAWNS) C'mon, pal.
Moe Szyslak: That's really stuck there good.
Moe Szyslak: (SMALL SMILE, SIGHS) I can't be mad at her no more.
Moe Szyslak: Goodnight, moon.

C. Montgomery Burns: All right, let's cut to the chase. My board has given me permission to go up to... (PORTENTOUS) twelve goats.
King: (AGGRAVATED NOISE)
(Island: Ext. island - day)
Waylon Smithers: How 'bout here, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm so sorry I pretended not to be gay for all those years. Better an old queen than never a queen at all.

King: Okay, fine. But, no dogs disguised as goats.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh great! Here comes the haggling!
(Moe's Tavern: Ext. Moe's - day - establishing)
Moe Szyslak: Well, well, look who's up. Princess, I'm gonna do something for you I've never done for anyone in this bar: call you a cab.

Moe Szyslak: Do you mind ridin' on a cute little scooter with your arms around my waist?
KEMI: (SHYLY) I don't.
Moe Szyslak: (LIFTS INDEX FINGER) To the scooter store!
(Springfield Streets: Ext. springfield streets - morning)
Moe Szyslak: And after you eat the soup you can eat the bowl or you can put coins ("KERNS") in it. Whatever you like.
KEMI: I have a confession to make. This is my first montage.
Moe Szyslak: Just relax and enjoy the music.
Homer Simpson: Moe Szyslak!
Homer Simpson: This is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches TV!
Moe Szyslak: (TO KEMI) Come with me.
(Street: Ext. street - moments later)
Moe Szyslak: Just move the pedals!
PEDICAB DRIVER: Whoa, sounds like the tower has cleared us for takeoff...
Moe Szyslak: We're tryin' to escape that guy!

Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Springfield: ext. springfield - another area - late afternoon)
PEDICAB DRIVER: So anyways, the place that I really feel the pedaling? It's my legs.
Moe Szyslak: (TO KEMI) Okay, all right, we're safe.
KEMI: Actually, I wanted to go back with him. I don't want to get my father mad.
Moe Szyslak: Go back? But I didn't show you the place where Dave Grohl got mugged.
KEMI: I have to leave. But I still had a wonderful day.
Moe's Thoughts: Thank God I shaved my forehead this morning.
KEMI: A paparazzo! Please don't send that! If my father sees it, it will ruin my life!
Paparazzo: Well thanks for making it so easy.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Int. Power plant - moments later)
King: And you have the twenty million goats.
C. Montgomery Burns: Two now. Nineteen million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety eight on delivery.
King: Very good.
Waylon Smithers: (WORRIED) Um, shouldn't we see how the Princess is doing before you sign, Your Majesty?
C. Montgomery Burns: What are you talking about, Smithers?
King: (APPALLED) I can't even trust you to watch an impetuous adult who does what she wants. The deal is off!
SMITHERS' THOUGHTS: Wow. After spending my life serving others, I'm finally gonna get what I want.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, there may be a bright side...
C. Montgomery Burns: There's never a bright side!
SMITHERS' THOUGHTS: (HAPPILY) He's almost mine!
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, you've torn that up all right.
KEMI: Father! I want to explain. I was a young woman who wanted to see the world, and this kind man has shown it to me.
King: And stolen your heart.
Moe Szyslak: Eh, well, that's what I do. Sorry, but there ain't no off switch for this.
KEMI: He has not stolen my heart.
Moe Szyslak: Wha?!
King: Why has he made the ancient tribal sound of confusion?
KEMI: I think he is a sweet, sweet man. But when I kissed him on the forehead, it was not romantic. More like when Snow White kissed Dopey.
Moe Szyslak: No, no, not this comparison again! (FRUSTRATED SOUND)
KEMI: I'm sorry, Moe. I don't love you, but I really like you.
King: Well, daughter. Even though you have done nothing seriously wrong, first I will tear this contract one more time.
King: (TO KEMI) And as for you, your punishment will be...
Homer Simpson: Uh, may I speak to you, Majesty, father to father?
King: (GASPS) A woman has allowed you to sire her children?
Homer Simpson: There was beer involved. I have two daughters. And I've learned you have to let them go their own way. Even the one-year-old.
Marge Simpson: (CURTSEYS) Majesty.
Homer Simpson: And the older one, I can't tell her what to do. And she's only twelve.
Lisa Simpson: Eight.
Homer Simpson: See what I mean? Always an argument.
Homer Simpson: But the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them...
King: I am not convinced.
Homer Simpson: ...uh, because you want them to grow...
King: Still not convinced.
Homer Simpson: ...and because you can't strangle a girl.
King: That makes sense.
Waylon Smithers: (STUNNED NOISE)
King: Come here, daughter.
KEMI: Oh, father.
Waylon Smithers: Little girl, let me give you some advice. Never dream big because it will blow up in your face.
Lisa Simpson: You're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.
Waylon Smithers: (SYMPATHETIC) Poor thing.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: Ext. Nuclear plant - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: So the good King's cheap uranium will allow me to sell you expensive nuclear power. Everyone wins.
Reporter: (UNINTERESTED) Yes, yes. Princess! Can you tell us about the man you kissed?
Moe Szyslak: I'll field that. Yesterday, a local man may or may not have given a tour to a certain princess, who, uh, one assumes, turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect.
KEMI: And yesterday, a certain Princess may or may not have seen much of your world with a certain man, and she certainly might be eternally grateful.
Reporter: (WRITING) Oh, this is vague stuff. Vague stuff!
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - night)
Moe Szyslak: I did not think this through.
KEMI: Moe, before I left, I just wanted to give you these examples of our most beloved, albeit depressing, literature.
Moe Szyslak: Ah, some nice bedtime readin'.
Moe Szyslak: Fun premise.
Moe Szyslak: I'm laughing already.
Moe Szyslak: Really not cheerin' me up here, but uh, let me offer you the only literature in this bar. Sure works for me though.
Moe Szyslak: This coaster.
KEMI: I will treasure it.
Moe Szyslak: Well, I guess you'll pine forever for a man who doesn't care, while I just grow old here in this bar.
Waylon Smithers: Here's to suffering in silence.

RICHARD BRANSON: I've set up the Virgin Earth Challenge, a twenty-five million dollar prize to eliminate greenhouse gasses, that I was hoping you would add to...
Lisa Simpson: You never let me tell!
C. Montgomery Burns: Where are the hounds when I need them?
RICHARD BRANSON: They're on a free Virgin Galactic flight around the world.

Captain Horatio McCallister: (DESPERATE) Without organized religion I've lost me moral compass. (BRANDISHES GUN) Also I've, uh, I've been addicted to Oxy for a while now... yar.

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Please do not call me a heathen. It offends Hanuman, the monkey-headed lord of winds, who believed the sun to be a ripe mango... Okay, I get it. I get why you say it.
Marge Simpson: Apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack.
Helen Lovejoy: (GASPS) The casino?!
Agnes Skinner: Blackjack's for suckers. My brother? He used to own three Arby's franchises -- lost 'em all at the tables and gave himself a shotgun tonsillectomy.
Agnes Skinner: What I told you was to wait in the car.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: The Mumbai Institute of Tantric Sex... where I was recruited by a card-counting ring.
Ned Flanders: Am I hearing this right? Is the church council truly considering... gambling?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: You know Ned, the Bible never explicitly condemns gambling. Biblical folks were always playing games of chance, like uh... drawing lots.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (ROLLS EYES) Card counting is not gambling. It is math.
Marge Simpson: And it's not even against the rules.
Bart Simpson: Dad, mom trusted us with a secret--
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Exactly. If you are caught you cannot be charged with any crime. The worst they will do is beat you with a phone book or break some fingers... But what is a little pain if your church is to be saved!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: It is all good.
(Kwik-E-Mart: ext. KWIK-E-MART - DAY - establishing)

Sideshow Mel: (FUMFERING NOISES)
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Get your head in the game, Mel!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Remember, for this legal but-frowned-upon scheme to work, we must have complete secrecy. Do not tell anyone what you are doing.
Marge Simpson: Not even Homer?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (TO MARGE, SIGHS) Homer is many things, but not a good accomplice. If he gets involved and this scheme fails, what happens to our church?
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED MURMUR) Even I saw that. (TO HERSELF) I guess I can't tell Homer.

Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES TO HIMSELF) Revue...
(RIVERBOAT CASINO: Ext. riverboat casino - ESTABLISHING)
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Card counting is simple.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: You all sit at different tables, betting low, playing hand after hand, "counting" in your head how many high cards are left in the deck.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Ignore all distractions!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: When the count is high, you have a "hot deck" and the odds are in your favor. Then, you use a secret signal to call in The Closer.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: The Closer bets big, wins bigger, and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally-acceptable screw job.
Lisa Simpson: --but she hasn't come home yet and we're worried she's in trouble!
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: But use caution. There are eyes everywhere. Sooner or later, the casino will catch on...

Marge Simpson: Uh... pop culture and current events.
Homer Simpson: How do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?
Marge Simpson: Both.
Homer Simpson: Nice. (THINKS) You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. Tell me about one.
Marge Simpson: Okay... There's a song about, um... how Democrats and Republicans can't get along. (INSPIRED) It's called "Cats and Dogs."

Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) Disguises? I'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest.
Ned Flanders: Why, I bet the Lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple. Our mission is one hundred percent pure.

Bart Simpson: Is Dad in on this takedown?
Marge Simpson: It's not a takedown! And I haven't told him about it -- yet.

Bart Simpson: Yeah, we are grown up.
Lisa Simpson: (PROUD) I know how much to tip a waiter.

Homer Simpson: Have you seen this woman? Have you? Have you seen my wife?
SECURITY THUG #1: This is your wife?
Homer Simpson: (DESPERATE) Do you know where she is?
SECURITY THUG #2: Uh, we'd like to ask you some questions in our "beating room."
Homer Simpson: All right, as long as it's just questions.
(LOVEJOY HOUSE: ext. lovejoy house - morning)

Helen Lovejoy: Your corpse bride is getting cold!

Helen Lovejoy: Was that a woman's voice? (SEDUCTIVE) Send her in!
Marge Simpson: If we don't give back the money we won counting cards, the casino people are going to hurt Homer!

SECURITY THUG #1: We don't do that. We don't even have a vise.
SECURITY THUG #2: We just want the money your wife stole from us.
Homer Simpson: Stole? How is counting cards stealing?
SECURITY THUG #2: Well, it's not really stealing.
Homer Simpson: Is it even cheating?
SECURITY THUG #2: No, but-- it's just not allowed.
Homer Simpson: I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?
SECURITY THUG #1: I can't take any more of this guy. Get the vise.
Homer Simpson: (SMUG) I knew you had a vise! I knew it!
(BURNED CHURCH: ext. burned church - continuous)
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I'm sorry, Marge. Maybe your husband's suffering was all part of God's plan.
Marge Simpson: God's plan?! God isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs! God isn't Sky Police. God didn't do this. I lied to my husband, and made my kids lie too! We did this.
Ned Flanders: She's right. We thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. But we were scathed! Those free ginger ales at the casino... I didn't declare them on my taxes!
Marge Simpson: I'm going to do what I should've done in the first place.

Marge Simpson: Maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them. Maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe. And I'm going to sit here and focus on that good, and maybe, just maybe, I'll get my husband back.

Casino Manager: We are going to release your husband.
Ned Flanders: See Marge, someone up in the sky did hear your prayers...
Marge Simpson: They sure did... casino management.
Casino Manager: You are free to leave as long as your faith-based card counting group never return to this or any other river or maritime casino.
Homer Simpson: No deal!
Marge Simpson: (SHOCKED) But we don't need to come back. We saved the church.
Homer Simpson: No! An injustice has gone on here for too long.
Homer Simpson: I'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. They're just playing the game by the rules!

TROY: (THRU TV) Hello. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such movies as "Cry Yuma!" and "Here Comes the Coast Guard". But today I'd like to talk to you about a pleasant-tasting candy that actually cleans and straightens your teeth.
TROY: (THRU TV) There's no confusion, Tina, just good science. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet the inventor, Dr. Nick Riviera.
TROY: Find a way.
TROY: I'm actor Troy McClure.
TROY: You might remember me from such TV series as "Buck Henderson, Union Buster" and "Troy and Company's Summertime Smile Factory," but I'm here to tell you about... Spiffy, a Twenty-First Century stain remover. Let's meet the inventor -- Dr. Nick Riviera.
TROY: One of our best writers.
TROY: So, what, I guess we're gonna throw it away.
TROY: Quoth the Raven, "What a shine!"
TROY: I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better, Doctor.
TROY: Hello, I'm actor Troy McClure. You kids might remember me from such educational films as "Lead Paint: Delicious But Deadly," and "Here Comes the Metric System!" I'm here to provide the facts about sex in a frank and straightforward manner. And now, here's "Fuzzy Bunny's Guide To You-Know-What."
TROY: This is Fuzzy Bunny. About a year ago he noticed his voice was changing, he had terrible acne, and had fur where there was no fur before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny!
TROY: Fluffy and Fuzzy went to the park... the ice cream social... the boat show... and various other wholesome activities. And they never ruined their fun by giving in to their throbbing biological urges. Then came the big day. Fluffy and Fuzzy got married!
TROY: (SLIGHTLY LEERING) That night came the honeymoon.
TROY: The most satisfying part of the night was knowing that they waited.
TROY: Nine months later, Fluffy gave birth to fourteen beautiful bunnies. Eight survive.
TROY: And now that you know how it's done, don't do it.
TROY: Here's an appealing fellow. In fact they're "a-peeling" him off the sidewalk.
TROY: (PRETENDING TO NOTICE CAMERA) Oh, hi. I'm Troy McClure. You might remember me from such self-help videos as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Confident, Stupid." Well now I'm here to tell you about the only real path to mental health. That's right, it's... the Brad Goodman... (SQUINTS TO READ) something or other.
TROY: A few weeks ago I was a washed up actor with a drinking problem. Then Brad Goodman came along and gave me this job and a can of fortified wine.
TROY: Ahhh. Sweet liquor eases the pain. And now I'd like to introduce the man who will put the "you" in impr-you-vement... Brad Goodman!
TROY: My God. It's like you've known me all my life.
TROY: Doctor, you've solved all my problems.
TROY: (GREEDY DRINKING NOISES)
TROY: This is Fuzzy Bunny. About a year ago, he noticed his voice was changing.
TROY: He had terrible acne. And had fur where there was no fur before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny.
TROY: Fuzzy went to the park, the ice cream social, the boat show and various other wholesome activities. And they never ruined their fun by giving in to their throbbing biological urges. Then came the big day. Fluffy and Fuzzy got married. That night came the honeymoon.
TROY: Mac, you gotta get me that part!
TROY: Oh, Princess Fair, willst thou grant me thine dainty hoof in marriage?
TROY: (AD LIB "WHOA"S ETC.; THEN:) Hey, these guys are all over the road!
TROY: No, just one. Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such films as "The Greatest Story Ever Hula'd" and "They Came to Burgle Carnegie Hall."
TROY: You wouldn't ask a handsome man like me to wear glasses? It'd be a crime against nature!
TROY: Ooof! (RECOVERING) Hel-looo, beautiful. John Law tells me I might need to wear these glasses.
TROY: Uh, W-seven-star-pound...
TROY: Look, Miss (READS NAMETAG) Boo-Veer. (FULL-OUT CHARM) As an actor I depend on my remarkable looks. If you could find it in your heart to pass me, I'm sure I could find some way to repay you...
TROY: ... Say, by buying you dinner?
TROY: (SUAVE) That took a lotta class.
TROY: (COVERING) Uh, yes, I'm over there.
TROY: (PERFUNCTORY) So... working at the DMV must be very interesting.
TROY: I've been reading a lot of scripts lately. (GUNG HO) You know, it's a lot cheaper than going to the movies.
TROY: (MILDLY) Yeah, me too... You need a ride somewhere?
TROY: Here you go, boys. A little something for Page One.
TROY: MacArthur Parker the agent? MacArthur Parker my agent?
TROY: We haven't spoken in 8 years.
TROY: You haven't found me work in 12 years.
TROY: (GETTING AN IDEA SOUND)
TROY: Hello, Selma Bouvier?
TROY: It's Troy McClure. You may remember me from such dates as last night's dinner...
TROY: That's right, boys. Troy's back from the gutter and he's brought someone with him!
TROY: (LAUGHS APPRECIATIVELY) That's too funny! I can't remember when I've heard a funnier anecdote! (LAUGHS AGAIN, THEN) Okay, now you tell one.
TROY: (DOESN'T GET IT) Really? Who was it? George Segal? I hear he plays the banjo.
TROY: Got a light?
TROY: Here, try one of my cigars.
TROY: That's not cigars, baby, that's love.
TROY: Just a second, baby.
TROY: (GUNG-HO) Selma, Jub-jub is fan-tastic. He's everywhere you wanna be.
TROY: (GUNG-HO) Welcome to your new home, baby. It's fan-tastic.
TROY: (DEADPAN) Garbage collection is Monday. If you wanna throw out a box, you have to cut it up.
TROY: Now you just make yourself at home here... I'll be sleeping downstairs in the Visitors' Center.
TROY: I'll see you in the morning. And get ready for tennis. It comes on at ten.
TROY: Uh... the movie or the planet?
TROY: It's the part I was born to play, baby!
TROY: (TALK-SINGING) GET YOUR PAWS OFF ME, YOU DIRTY APE!!
TROY: (BREAKING FREE) I CAN SIIIIING!
TROY: (TALK-SINGING) WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
TROY: I WANT A SECOND OPINION.
TROY: CAN I PLAY THE PIANO ANYMORE?
TROY: WELL, I COULDN'T BEFORE.
TROY: (SINGING) I HATE EVERY APE I SEE / FROM CHIMPAN A TO CHIMPAN Z! / NO, YOU'LL NEVER MAKE A MONKEY OUT OF ME!
TROY: OH MY GOD! I WAS WRONG! / IT WAS EARTH ALL ALONG! / YOU'VE FINALLY MADE A MONKEY -
TROY: YES, YOU'VE FINALLY MADE A MONKEY OUT OF ME!
TROY: (SPOKEN) I love you, Dr. Zaius.
TROY: Thank you, it's great to be back! I just want to say I wouldn't be here without the support of a very special lady -- my always outrageous fianceé, Selma. Take a bow, Sugarbeet!
TROY: My good looks paid for that pool, and my talent filled it with water! Hi, I'm Troy McClure -- your future uncle!
TROY: (PROUD) You know, I was one of the first to speak out against horseplay.
TROY: (TIPSY) Yeah, it's a good idea, Homer, but they've already made some movies about World War Two...
TROY: (TIPSY) Homer, I'm really touched you invited me out on the town. You're gonna be a four-star brother-in-law.
TROY: (DRUNK BUT SMOOTH) C'mere, Homer.
TROY: I'll let you in on a little secret...
TROY: It's a good day for me too, baby. Now smile. We're gonna be on every newsstand in the country!
TROY: This better be important. It's my wedding night. I'm trying to sleep.
TROY: (TO PHONE) T. McC.!
TROY: Yeah, in a minute. Darling. (HANGS UP) Well, she may be helping my career, but she's starting to cramp my style.
TROY: (KIRK DOUGLAS-EY) Those sick freaks?!
TROY: McBain's sidekick?! Hot damn! (JUMPS IN THE AIR) I'm going to Sea World!
TROY: Sure, baby. Is that a problemo?
TROY: You make it sound so sordid. Look, don't we have a good time together?
TROY: Don't you have everything you ever wanted here? Money, security, a big hot flat rock for Jub-jub?
TROY: (SINCERELY) Sure I do. Like I love Fresca. Isn't that enough? The only difference between our marriage and anyone else's is, we know ours is a sham.
TROY: Gay? I wish! If I were gay there'd be no problem. No, what I have is a romantic abnormality -- one so unbelievable that it must be hidden from the public at all costs. You see--
KRABAPPEL: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, I think you know our District Psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
BLEEDING GUMS: We all thought it was funny. (CHUCKLES)
TROY: It's remarkably easy! Just smile for the cameras and enjoy Mr. Troy's Wild Ride! You'll go to the right parties, meet the right people -- sure, you'll be a sham wife -- but you'll be the envy of every other sham wife in town! So whad'ya say, baby?
TROY: One day my lady Selma's gonna have a star right next to mine, so watch out (PEERS AT ADJOINING STAR) Laszlo Panaflex!
TROY: (WHINY) But I already got married!
TROY: A baby, eh? What do I do?
TROY: C'est Troy bien!
TROY: Uh... Oregon?
TROY: You bet it is! Think what it'll mean! Not just the McBain movie, but maybe my own fragrance... "Smellin' of Troy"!
TROY: You bet! From now on she's smoking for two!
TROY: (RELIEVED) Yes!
TROY: (WARILY) No, why don't you come over here and make yourself comfortable? (THEN) I'm sorry, this whole concept's foreign to me. Who knew a baby would be so much work? (POUNDS WALL)
TROY: Oh, like how we built that snowman together in that Newport ad? Remember how "alive with pleasure" they said we were?
TROY: (SIGH OF RELIEF) Oh, great, we'll adopt. I'll call my agent, he'll find some kid who wants in on the deal.
KRABAPPEL: (APPLAUDS) Oh! Absolutely brilliant. There were moments I truly believed you were Hemingway. Bravo, Martin.
KRABAPPEL: All right, class, all right. I think we have time for one more report.
KRABAPPEL: (FROM ATTENDANCE LIST) Bart Simpson?
KRABAPPEL: Is your book report on "Treasure Island" ready?
KRABAPPEL: (RUBBING HER EYES) Bart, did you read the book?
KRABAPPEL: Then perhaps you'd like to tell us the name of the pirate.
KRABAPPEL: Sit down, Bart. I'll see you after class.
KRABAPPEL: Your grades have gotten steadily worse since the beginning of the term. Are you aware of that?
KRABAPPEL: Are you aware that there is a major exam tomorrow on Colonial America?
KRABAPPEL: Bart! You haven't been paying attention to a word I said, have you?
KRABAPPEL: Well then what did I say?
KRABAPPEL: (FRUSTRATED) That was a lucky guess!
KRABAPPEL: (WEARILY) What is it, Bart?
KRABAPPEL: Why, this test is worse than Milhouse's exam. Bart Simpson, I warned you. This is the final straw!
KRABAPPEL: Bart has failed his last four exams in history. (TO BART) Is there anything you're not telling us?
KRABAPPEL: Look at these results. Fifty-five, forty-two, twenty-six... a twelve on State capitals...
KRABAPPEL: All right, class... the topic is World Literature. What was the pirate's name in "Treasure Island"?
KRABAPPEL: Bart Simpson?
KRABAPPEL: I heard that Bart, Jr. I want to see both of you after class today.
KRABAPPEL: (CACKLING) I haven't had this much fun in years!
KRABAPPEL: Please turn in your exam, Bart. Class is over.
KRABAPPEL: Well, all right. Let me get "Old Red."
KRABAPPEL: (HANDING TEST BACK) Well, Bart. It's a fifty-nine. That's another F.
KRABAPPEL: I know, I know. Another year together. Ugh! It's gonna be hell.
KRABAPPEL: Bart, what's the matter? I would think that you'd be used to failing by now.
KRABAPPEL: There, there...
KRABAPPEL: (OFFERING) Well, a fifty-nine... it's a high F.
KRABAPPEL: What?
KRABAPPEL: My God, Bart. You're right!
KRABAPPEL: You just demonstrated applied knowledge. And due to the difficulty and relative obscurity of the reference you deserve an extra point on your exam. Hey, it's only fair.
KRABAPPEL: Just barely.
KRABAPPEL: Good one, Milhouse. Anyone else? The first message by wireless...
KRABAPPEL: Oh, Warren, I nearly forgot. All Junior Campers are excused to attend their patrol meeting.
KRABAPPEL: Hello? (KNOCKS) Hello?... We're here for the field trip...
KRABAPPEL: (FIGHTING TEARS) You dream about this day for so long, then when it comes, you don't know what to say.
BROCKMAN: Hello, I'm Kent Brockman, and welcome to another edition of "Smartline". (BEAT) Are cartoons too violent for children? Most people would say "no. Of course not. What kind of stupid question is that?" But one woman says "yes." She's here with us tonight. Mrs. Marge Simpson.
BROCKMAN: Also with us for this "animated" discussion... (CHUCKLES)... are Roger Myers, Chairman of the board of Itchy & Scratchy International...
BROCKMAN: ... Krusty the Klown, whose delightful program brings us the antics of Itchy & Scratchy every afternoon at four...
BROCKMAN: And, joining us live via satellite from Vienna, the home of Sigmund Freud - the world's most famous psychiatrist - to give us an insight into the human mind, Dr. Marvin Monroe.
BROCKMAN: Now, first let's see what all the excitement is about. Here's an example of the work currently being turned out at I & S Studios.
BROCKMAN: (CHUCKLES) Hilarious. (TURNS TO MARGE) Now, what in the world is wrong with that, Mrs. Simpson?
BROCKMAN: (LIKE STEVE ALLEN) I see. Fascinating.
BROCKMAN: And this was before cartoons were invented?
BROCKMAN: Dr. Marvin Monroe in Vienna, would you care to comment on all this?
BROCKMAN: So you have no professional objection to Itchy & Scratchy?
BROCKMAN: (CHUCKLING) Not a thing. Now, for another opinion...
BROCKMAN: (CHUCKLES) Krusty, please. We're giving you an opportunity to participate in a serious discussion here.
BROCKMAN: (BARKING) Krusty!
BROCKMAN: Well, it looks like we're not going to settle this tonight. Mrs. Simpson, in the nine seconds we have left, could you summarize your position for us?
BROCKMAN: Is it a masterpiece? Or just some guy with his pants down? That's our topic tonight on "Smartline". (TURNS TO MARGE) Now, Mrs. Simpson, why are you against this statue?
BROCKMAN: Wait, wait a minute. Aren't you Marge Simpson, the wacko?
BROCKMAN: Live, from Radio City Music Room in downtown Springfield -- it's "The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour!"
BROCKMAN: Featuring "The Waylon Smithers Dancers!"
BROCKMAN: "And the Springfield Baggy-Pants Players!"
BROCKMAN: And now, a family that doesn't know the meaning of the word "cancelled" -- The Simpsons!
BROCKMAN: Ah, I said "Mmph."
ROGER MYERS, JR.: So, let's review: You two screwballs have just strolled in here, fresh from the sewer, and given me a bunch of bulldink about creating Itchy with no proof at all, and you expect me to give you... how much?
ROGER MYERS, JR.: (OUTRAGED) That's a lie!
ROGER MYERS, JR.: Well, I don't think I am under oath. But, yes, my father created them all. Except for Flatulent Fox. That was based on a true story. But he did create Itchy. That's one thing I am sure of.
BLEEDING GUMS: This isn't a saxophone, it's an umbrella.
ROGER MYERS, JR.: Okay. Maybe my dad did steal Itchy, but so what! Animation is built on plagiarism! (BUILDING, PACING AROUND) If it weren't for someone plagiarizing the Honeymooners, we wouldn't have the Flintstones. If someone hadn't ripped off Sergeant Bilko, there'd be no Top Cat. (COUNTS ON ONE HAND) Huckleberry Hound, Chief Wiggum, Yogi Bear? (COUNTS ON THE OTHER HAND) Andy Griffith, Edward G. Robinson, Art Carney. Your honor, you take away our right to steal ideas--
ROGER MYERS, JR.: (SHOUTING OVER GAVEL) -- where are they gonna come from? (POINTS TO MARGE, SNIDELY) Her?!
ROGER MYERS, JR.: (TO BART) I hope you're happy, kid. The studio's bankrupt. You just killed Itchy and Scratchy.
ROGER MYERS, JR.: Royalties? Huh! I don't have the money to produce the cartoons. I lost everything! I can't even keep my dad's head in the friggin' cryogenics center anymore.
ROGER MYERS, JR.: (SARCASTIC) Ya comfortable in there, Daddy?!
ROGER MYERS, JR.: And so, when no one could think of a plan to resurrect Itchy and Scratchy, a young boy, a wonderful irrepressible young boy took it on his own to solve the problem.
ROGER MYERS, JR.: He discovered that the Postal Service's Mr. Zip was just a rip-off of my father's stick figure character "Manic Mailman."
ROGER MYERS, JR.: So the government gave me a huge cash settlement and Itchy and Scratchy Studios is back in business. Thanks to you, Lester.
ROGER MYERS, JR.: Hey, great. Listen, write it down and mail it to last week when I might have cared. I've got cartoons to make, kids.
MEYERS: You call this writing!? If I puked in a fountain pen and mailed it to the monkey house I'd get better scripts!
MEYERS: At Harvard... hit the streets, egghead! You should've majored in Not-Getting-Fired.
MEYERS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. (READING) Dear Mr. Meyers: My brother and I watch your show. You should be proud that children everywhere blah - blah - blah - bling - bling - bling - blah.
MEYERS: Hey egghead!
MEYERS: Sing "Fair Harvard."
MEYERS: Here's a witty rejoinder for ya.
MEYERS: What?
MEYERS: Shut up.
MEYERS: Roxie, get me Abraham Simpson!
MEYERS: You're a comedy writer? My God, you're so old...
MEYERS: (CHUCKLES) You're a writer all right. (HANDS HIM A CHECK) All right, here you go, Simpson.
MEYERS: You're a funny guy. How would you like a staff job? I'll start you at eight hundred dollars a week.
MEYERS: All right, leeches, I want you to see what a good writer looks like. His name is Abraham Simpson and he's got something you couldn't get at your fancy schools... life experience.
MEYERS: Quiet! Abe, tell 'em about your amazing life.
MEYERS: Wow!
MEYERS: Hey, how would you kids like a tour of the studio?
MEYERS: Abe, you comin'?
MEYERS: Just one.
MEYERS: Well, we cut corners. Sometimes, to save money, our animators will re-use the same backgrounds over and over and over again...
MEYERS: Good news, Abe.
MEYERS: No, no. You've been nominated for an award. You're so good I've fired the other writers. From now on the fate of the entire company rests on that delightful coconut of yours.
MEYERS: (NOT LISTENING) Sorry, I didn't catch any of that. (CHECKS WATCH) And now, I gotta go.
McBain: But, Captain, I have proof that he's head of an international drug cartel.
McBain: That makes two of us.
McBain: (GERMAN ACCENT) Only your death.
McBain: Meeting adjourned.
McBain: Right now I'm thinking about holding another meeting... in bed.
McBain: But, Captain. I can't avenge my partner's death with this pea shooter.
McBain: Bye, book.
McBain: C'mon, live a little, Scoey.
McBain: Little Suzy's growing up.
McBain: Yes?
McBain: Stop talkin' crazy.
McBain: Mendozaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!
McBain: (CUPPING HAND OVER EAR, SINGING) WE'LL GO ON TV AND SING, SING, SING.
McBain: Ice to see you.
McBain: (AGREEABLY) All right.
McBain: Ahhh! Ahhh!
McBain: Ya. Thank you. Ya, that's nice. Let's say hello to my music guy, Scoey.
McBain: That is some outfit, Scoey. It makes you look like a homosexual.
McBain: (TO CROWD) Maybe you all are homosexuals too.
McBain: Did you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up? (BEAT) That's the joke.
McBain: Now, my Woody Allen impression: I'm a neurotic nerd who likes to sleep with little girls.
McBain: (SINGING) MEIN BRATWURST HAS A FIRST NAME, IT'S F-R-I-T-Z / MEIN BRATWURST HAS A SECOND NAME, IT'S S-C-H-N-A-C-K-E-N-P-F-E-F-F-E-R-H-A-U-S-E-N...
McBain: McBain to base. Under attack by Commie Nazis.
McBain: (AS HE WALKS TO REAR OF PLANE) They won't stop me from delivering these UNICEF pennies.
McBain: Go, pennies! Help the puny children who need you.
McBain: Not so fast.
McBain: The winner is... me. For being seen with you freaks.
McBain: Welcome to Planet Springfield. The restaurant owned by me, Chuck Norris, Johnny Carson's third wife and the Russian Mafia.
McBain: Each Planet Springfield is filled with priceless Hollywood gewgaws.
McBain: You are suffering from a reptile dysfunction.
WOLFCASTLE: Up and AT THEM!
WOLFCASTLE: Up and AT THEM!
WOLFCASTLE: Shut up, old lady. And stop kicking me there.
WOLFCASTLE: (RE: BELLY) It's for a movie. I'm filling a fat secret agent.
BLEEDING GUMS: (SINGS) "O-oo-hhhhhhh... Oh Saaayyyyy can you..." -- I'm askin' -- "Can you s-e-e-e? ...By the d-a-a-a-w-wn's"

BLEEDING GUMS: (SMILES) Little Lisa. It's good to see you again.
BLEEDING GUMS: My friends call me Bleeding Gums.
BLEEDING GUMS: Well let me put it this way. You ever been to the dentist?
BLEEDING GUMS: Not me. I suppose I should go to one, but I've got enough pain in my life as it is.
BLEEDING GUMS: What are you here for?
BLEEDING GUMS: Is he going to be okay?
BLEEDING GUMS: Lisa, I sure am glad you dropped by. You're the first visitor I've had.
BLEEDING GUMS: I don't really have a family. All I had was a little brother who grew up to become a doctor. He used to laugh at the most inappropriate times.
BLEEDING GUMS: Well, I always had my music. I learned at the feet of Blind Willy Witherspoon.
BLEEDING GUMS: Then I got my big break. I was on Steve Allen's Tonight Show.
BLEEDING GUMS: I cut my first and only album, "Sax on the Beach."
BLEEDING GUMS: (SADLY) But then I spent all my money on my $1500 a day habit.
BLEEDING GUMS: I'd like another Fabergé egg please.
BLEEDING GUMS: (SNAPPING) I'll tell you when I've had enough!
BLEEDING GUMS: In '86 when I did a guest shot on "The Cosby Show."
BLEEDING GUMS: Baby, you are gonna knock 'em dead. (COUGHS TWICE) Here -- take this for luck.
BLEEDING GUMS: (WARMLY) Well, before you came to visit, I would have agreed with you.
BLEEDING GUMS: So you all set for your recital?
BLEEDING GUMS: Aw, Lisa, honey, music comes from what's in your heart, not what's on your teeth. Come on, let's jam.
BLEEDING GUMS: You've made an old jazz-man happy, Lisa.
BLEEDING GUMS: Will you guys pipe down? I'm saying good-bye to Lisa.
BLEEDING GUMS: Sorry, but I have to. Good-bye.
BLEEDING GUMS: Ah, what the heck. Once more, from the top!
BLEEDING GUMS: Oh, come on, Lisa. I got a date with Billie Holliday.
"G. K. Willington": If you ask me, the Royal Shakespeare Company's latest season was "much ado about nothing."
G. K. Willington: I would be delighted to dine with you on the twelfth. (WRITES IN DATE BOOK)

G. K. Willington: (SINGS) AND NEVER SOIL MY SUIT.
G. K. Willington: I COULD BE SO POLITE / START NOT A SINGLE FIGHT / AND STILL NOT FEEL LIKE A FRUIT!
"G. K. Willington": (SINGS) HOW VERY NICE / THAT THERE'S NO LICE / IN MY HAIR / AND MY TOENAILS I DON'T BITE / NOW THAT I'VE REACHED THE STAGE / WHERE I'M NOT FULL OF RAGE / I COULD BE INDOORS, INDOORS, ALL NIGHT!
"G. K. Willington": Good morning, Lisa! What's the lesson for today? How to smoke a pipe while summoning a falcon?
"G. K. Willington": (TO FALCON) Put the kettle on, Featherbee. I'll be home soon.
G. K. Willington: But... I don't know what to do with myself. All I've ever been is a groundskeeper.
Young Homer: Hmmm... hey, something's blocking it.
"G. K. Willington": Good evening, sir. I'm your maitre d'.
G. K. Willington: (POLITE CHUCKLE)
"G. K. Willington": Right this way, ma'am.
"G. K. Willington": May I help you, sir?
G. K. Willington: (SINGS) I'VE A FANCY SUIT AND A CLEAN WHITE SHIRT / BUT I MISS THE DAYS WHEN TRACTOR FUMES BLEW UP MY SKIRT
"G. K. Willington": (SINGS) I WAS FREEZING COLD, AND I SLEPT IN MOLD / BUT I LONG FOR THE SHACK WHERE I LIVED.
"G. K. Willington": (SINGS) SHE WAS TRUE TO ME, MY OLD HOME OF WOOD
G. K. Willington: (SINGS) AND WHEN I PASSED OUT DRUNK FROM TURPENTINE SHE UNDERSTOOD
G. K. Willington: (SINGS) LIFE WAS SO SUBLIME...
G. K. Willington: (LIKE DAVID NIVEN) I'm ebullient! I'm bubbling with glee! I'm... (WILLIE-LIKE) bloody miserable! I miss me crap shack!
"G. K. Willington": (LIKE DAVID NIVEN) Sir, there are many other tables available. (GESTURES)
"G. K. Willington": (CONTROLLED ANGER) Sir, there is a child present.
Young Homer: (NOT LOOKING UP) You taping it?
Young Homer: I'll watch it later.
Young Homer: Marge, please, I'm busy.
Young Homer: Zookeeper! Zookeeper! Those two monkeys are killing each other!
Young Homer: Oh.
Young Homer: (IMPRESSED) Wow! (JFK IMPRESSION) Look at me, er uh, Mom! I am, 'er uh, President Kennedy!
Young Homer: Take out wrenched ankle.
Young Homer: (BUZZ-Y VOICE) Mom! Mom! Mom!
Young Homer: Sing me my bedtime song, mom.
Young Homer: Darn tootin'
Young Homer: ... big Fig Newton!
Young Homer: (HAPPY DANCING SOUNDS THAT MIMIC THE GUITAR PLAYING)
Young Homer: But I want to play in the mud and be a hippie.
Young Homer: (DISGUSTED) How could you let me turn into you.
Young Homer: (MOCKING) B-b-b-b-but the poncho. (THEN) Hit the road, square.
Young Homer: BOM BOM BOM BOM
Young Homer: BOM BOM BOM BOM
Young Homer: Hey thanks, Moe.
Young Homer: Friends forever?
Young Homer: Geronimooo -- oh my God!
Young Homer: (CRIES OF PAIN, BUT NOT AS ANGUISHED AS HIS SCREAMS IN THE HOUSE)
Young Homer: Hey, what happened to all the water?
Young Homer: (AS HE POKES) What the heck is that thing?
Young Homer: (SCREAMS)
Young Homer: (TIPSY) Marge, come here.
Young Homer: Marge, I need both hands for this game. Can you feed me nachos while I play?
Young Homer: Tell that to the brave crew of the S.S. Triangle.
Young Homer: Come on! You're always saying we should do things as a couple.
Young Homer: Oh, this is wonderful. I love you, Atari.
Young Homer: (OBLIVIOUS) Well, I aims to please. Hey, let's stop by that dumpster and make out. (GAGS, THEN: HOLDS UP FINGER) Hold that thought.
Young Homer: (ROMANTIC) With you, baby, Top Ramen tastes like Cup O' Noodles.
Young Homer: (SEDUCTIVE) You know these IKEA foam futons do Velcro together.
Young Homer: (SWEETLY) I understand. We should follow the lead of today's celebrity role models.
Young Homer: Okay everyone, let's warm up our harmonies. (SINGING FIRST NOTE IN ARPEGGIO) HOMER...
Young Homer: (SHOCKED) You applied to college? Why didn't you tell me?
Young Homer: I thought you were telling me you wanted to apply yourself to making a collage. (STERNLY) And as I recall, I was against it.
Young Homer: (BREAKING DOWN) Oh baby, you deserve every last bit of it! I can get the money. But it'll mean swallowing my pride and working for (SNEERING) my Dad...
Young Homer: None of your business. Now give me a job at your business.
Young Homer: Okay, all right! Time's up!
Young Homer: (SMALL SOBS) This book sucks so much.
Young Homer: Even Walt Disney?
Young Homer: Really? I thought it was written by losers. (HEARTY LAUGH ENDING IN SIGH)
Young Homer: Professor August, eh? Who is he, some grey-haired old bookworm?
Young Homer: I've never heard that noise before. Are you sick?
Young Homer: Hm... I wonder what's on your mind...
Young Homer: (CHUCKLES) Oh Elaine, will you ever find someone who's sponge-worthy?
Young Homer: Here's what I say to that: no soup for you! Because I am "master of my domain." (SNEERING) Newman.
Young Homer: Hey, I worked hard all day to pay for your education. Can't I get all Zima-ed up and have my best girl put salve on my laser burns?
Young Homer: Apparently if all the kids fire at your stomach at once, it adds up.
Young Homer: Are you by that (MISPRONOUNCING) Joan Miro statue?
Young Homer: (UPSET) Hey, it's townies like me that cook your food and clean your bathrooms!
Young Homer: What the hell is going on here? (OBSERVING) Chanting?!
Young Homer: Marge, what are you doing in this crazy college? This place is nothing like "Animal House"! I smashed a beatnik's guitar and he sued me for damages! Successfully!
Young Homer: Slam!
Young Homer: I can't do it! Our harmony-laden R&B doesn't make sense in this cruel world. I'm taking our music to the next level: Guitar Rock Utilizing Nihilist Grunge Energies. Or, as I call it: GRUNGE.
Young Homer: We are Sadgasm, and this song is called... "Politically Incorrect."
Young Homer: (SINGING) PAIN IS BROWN / HATE IS WHITE / LOVE IS BLACK / STAB THE NIGHT /
Young Homer: KINGDOM OF NUMB / CLOSET OF HURT / FEELINGS ARE DUMB / KISSES ARE DIRT...
Young Homer: Marge!
Young Homer: Hey Marge.
Young Homer: Now why would I be angry and bitter? Because I'm paying for you to make goo-goo eyes at some smooth-talking professor?
Young Homer: (SARCASTIC) Well if you feel that way, maybe you can find someone who wants to nurture the new you, maybe someone a little older and more sophisticated, who can take you to Europe during the summer.
Young Homer: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Young Homer: (DISINTERESTED) Yeah.
Young Homer: Okay, I'll keep the L.P.s and you take the C.D.s. I'll take the typewriter, you take the computer. I'll take the Enron stock, you take the Microsoft stock. And um...
Young Homer: (KINDLY) I just want a tentacle.
Young Homer: Gimme a beer, Moe.
Young Homer: Fine. Cohiba me.
Young Homer: (STOPPING HIM) Leave the humidor.
Young Homer: (SIGHS) Seeing Marge always reminds me of Marge.
Young Homer: (SINGING) RAZORBLADE OF APATHY / SHAVE ME WITH YOUR IRONY / (ALMOST SCREAMING) SHAVE ME, SHAVE ME...
Young Homer: Why aren't I happy? I'm the hottest grunge artist on Mucous Records, Weird Al is doing a parody of my song...
Young Homer: (SHUTS OFF TV, SAD MOAN) He who is tired of Weird Al is tired of life.
Young Homer: (SINGING) SPREAD YELLOW GUNK / ON MY PANCAKE HEART / COUNTRY-CHURNED GIRL / IN MY GROCERY CART
Young Homer: I PAID FOR HER DREAMS / SHE TAUGHT ME TO CRY / LIKE WATERY KNIVES / LIKE RAIN FROM MY EYES / I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT MINE / I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT MINE...
Young Homer: MARGE-A-RINE / MARGE-A-RINE / MARGE-A-RINE / (SCREAMING) MARGE-A-RINE / (SCREAMING) MARGE-A-RINE...
Young Homer: (MUMBLING) I need it...
Young Homer: (WEAKLY) But I need it...
Young Homer: Of course. The thing that stood between us -- the nineties -- is almost over.
Young Homer: At least we know there'll never be a president worse than Bill Clinton. Imagine, lying in a deposition in a civil lawsuit. That's the worst sin a president could commit.
Young Homer: Never.
Young Homer: (AMOROUS KISSING NOISES)
Young Homer: Why you little!...
Young Homer: Creepy. You can have mine, Bongo.
Young Homer: (SINGING TO SELF) LITTLE HOMER HAD A DOG / AND BONGO WAS HIS NAME-O / B-O-ON-ON-GO / B-O-ON-ON-GO...
Young Homer: A hole next to the seat to hold my cup?
Young Homer: Where are we going, Daddy?
Young Homer: (WORRIED) Miss Viola? Isn't she cuckoo?
Young Homer: Okay. How long till we come back and get him?
Young Homer: What?! (THROWS ARMS AROUND DOG) No! No! No! Bongo!! (HUGE SOBS AND WAILS)
Young Homer: (HALF-WAKING UP, GROGGY) Where's Bongo? Is he still at the crazy lady's...
Young Homer: (NOT LOOKING AT HIM) Ketchup, please.
Young Homer: (COLD) I'm-not-hungry-anymore.
Young Grampa: Okay.
Young Grampa: (SINCERELY) I promise.
Young Grampa: (SINGING) WON'T YOU COME HOME FRANZ BRAUDER / WON'T YOU COME HOME...
Young Grampa: Feh! The way people act around here, you'd think the streets were paved with gold.
Young Grampa: Whee, I love America!
Young Grampa: (GASP) He's a Nazi! Get him!
Young Grampa: Edwina, my slowly-opening flower, I'm shippin' out in the morning -- won't you make this night memorable?
Young Grampa: I'll never forget you, Edwina!
Young Grampa: Well, I don't usually drink after lunch, but (SEEING PLANES) oh, my God the sky is fulla that kinda plane that crashes into the boat!
Young Grampa: Cyrus, you be careful up there.
Young Grampa: (GROWING ALARM) Lieutenant! Radio my brother and tell him to watch his tail!
Young Grampa: Cyrus!!! (SHAKING FIST) You'll pay for that, you haiku-spoutin' savages!
Young Grampa: (DOPPLER) I wish I'd tried reefer!
Young Grampa: Quit lollygagging and build a fire!
Young Grampa: A shaving kit! (IMPRESSED) Is this pomade?
Young Grampa: (TOUCHED) Thanks, Lieutenant. Merry Christmas.
Young Grampa: Incoming! Is it one of ours?
Young Grampa: What in the name of the Tennessee Valley Authority?
Young Grampa: You useless waste of socks! That ain't no Kraut! We just shot down Santy Claus!
Young Grampa: Well, we'll get you up and running or my name ain't Young Grampa Simpson!
Young Grampa: You backstabber! (REGRETFUL) And I let you spoon me.
Young Grampa: Let's go, you flying hat rack!
Young Grampa: (DOPPLER YELL)
Young Grampa: C'mon, baby!
Young Grampa: (TO BURNS) Somebody shoulda beat you with a tricycle years ago!
Young Grampa: (EXCITED) Clark Gable!
Young Grampa: Hey, boys -- these sharks can't bite us if we're on their backs!
Young Grampa: I sure have, Mr. Gable. How come you ain't a star yet?
Young Grampa: Oh, it's called "Gone With The Wind." You can have it -- it's only got one swear word, and not a very good one.
Young Grampa: (FURIOUS) Look at these grades! They're a disgrace! No TV for a week!
Young Grampa: Who did this?
Young Grampa: (BELIEVING HIM, FURIOUS) She did?! Then I'm gonna withhold affection without telling her why!
Young Grampa: (SINGS) MY HEART DOES THE TWO-STEP WHEN YOU WALTZ IN THE PLACE--
Young Grampa: Rita Lafleur singing one of my tunes?! Can a thirty-five-year-old busboy's life get any better?
Young Grampa: That's fine, doll. Real fine. Why we'll...
Young Grampa: Y'know... Europe's no place for a six-year-old. He can handle a hundred-and-ten volt, but two-twenty would kill him.
Young Grampa: I know, Sugar Tomato, but I'm all the family this boy's got. If I don't take care of him now, he'll forget the day he's supposed to come and see me when I'm old.
Teenage Homer: Psst, Barney! My Dad's asleep. Want a beer?
Young Grampa: (PULLING IT TOGETHER) Well of course I'm okay, I'm with you! (SOFTLY) Goodbye, Rita. This is why "life" comes before "love" in the dictionary.
Young Grampa: Aw, thanks, son. Now to make sure neither of us ever remember this.
Young Grampa: Now, my dear, we can watch "Mannix" as a couple.
Young Grampa: (UNHAPPY STARTLED NOISE) I had no clue.
Young Grampa: Get him out of here, son! Now!
Young Grampa: Mr. Burns, I'm awfully sorry...
Young Grampa: Gosh, Miss Viola, I want you and your husband to know how much I appreciate this.
Young Grampa: Son... why don't you give him your sweatshirt so he'll remember you.
Young Grampa: He's already gone! Where you'll never get him!
Young Grampa: Listen... I can think of something you'd enjoy more than killing a dog.
Young Grampa: (GASP)
Young Grampa: How was school today?
Young Grampa: Probably wondering how I got rabies... Well...
Young Grampa: Why can't you be happy ironing my shirts?!
Young Grampa: Then close your eyes and go to Hawaii!
Young Grampa: Don't worry, just a day at the beach!
Young Grampa: I'll be back around nineteen forty-six!
Young Grampa: (PANICKY) Son! Look over there! (POINTS)
Young Grampa: (SPUTTERS) I mean, look over there!
Young Grampa: Ten bucks a cone?! Look back at the elephant!
Young Grampa: Why are you askin' me? Is your thumb broken?
Young Grampa: Have him back by Father's Day!
Young Marge: Okay.
Young Marge: You know what I want to be when I grow up?
Young Marge: No, I'm going to be an astronaut.
Young Marge: Why not?
Young Marge: There will too be women astronauts!
Young Marge: It's true! And we'll all live in cities on the moon.
Young Marge: I don't want a life of watching you get drunk, then holding back your long, beautiful hair while you vomit. I have my own dreams and I can't live them with you.
Teenage Homer: I've got two words for you. Mellow out, man. Hmm? Hmm?
Teenage Homer: Wish me luck, Dad.
Young Marge: Homie, I was so worried about you. I was really mad at you tonight, but you're a good person and that's what I see most of the time. Whatever problems we have, we have a lifetime to work them out. Together.
Young Marge: Fraternity pledges in their beanies...
Young Marge: (DREAMY) I think I'm gonna like it here.
Young Marge: Are you saying that America was founded on... misconceptions?
Young Marge: (NERVOUS LAUGH) Three to five, right?
Young Marge: I will!
Young Marge: (IMPRESSED SWOON)
Young Marge: (GUILTY NOISE)
Young Marge: (BIGGER GASP)
Young Marge: (GIGGLES) Thank you, Professor August.
Young Marge: Oh, thanks. (A LITTLE EMBARRASSED) It's just a note from my boyfriend.
Young Marge: But Homer's so supportive. He's paying for me to go to college.
Young Marge: Well, I know you'd never say anything that isn't objective...
Young Marge: When is it due?
Young Marge: (A LITTLE SURPRISED) Steffan!
Young Marge: Consent, of course.
Young Marge: Just do it already!
Young Marge: I thought they were just tall so boats could see them.
Young Marge: (POINTS) Look, a wedding!
Young Marge: You oppose marriage?
Young Marge: But Steffan, I would like to get married some day.
Young Marge: It's statements like that that... (AT A LOSS) are mean!
Young Marge: No you don't!
Young Marge: There'll never be a worse president. Never.
Young Burns: (SINCERE) You know, Simpson, we've had our dust-ups... So I've made you a little peace offering.
Young Burns: (MODEST) It's nothing really. Just seagull brains and snail goo.
Young Burns: Who cares? It's Christmas. I want to shoot something!
Young Burns: (PATRONIZING) Yes, yes. Everything happens to you.
Young Burns: Oh, I'll be all right. (FURIOUS) Once I hold your dying pet in my arms and feel his wagging tail go stiff!
Young Burns: I'm not done with you. I insist you never wear shoes or a proper necktie again. Just house slippers and the most humiliating tie there is: (OMINOUS) bolo.
Young Burns: The adventures of The Good Shepherd and his sidekick, The Fleecy Kid.
Young Burns: That's his battle cry! (LIKE A SHEEP) Baaa! The sound which terrifies sheep rustlers the length and breadth of Michigan's untamed upper peninsula!
Young Burns: (SKETCHING) There's heat, I just don't turn it on.
Young Burns: Seeing you there, in the sweet light of Paris between the wars, there is a question I must pose.
Young Burns: I have something for you.
Young Burns: Nope. Not that.
Young Burns: Wrong box.
Young Burns: (INTENSE, IN LOVE) Lilah, will you take that big step from cousin to wife?
Young Burns: When you say others... could they be bars of gold?
Young Burns: No one's that good!
Young Krusty: But I want to make people laugh.
Young Krusty: Papa, when I grow up, can I be a clown?
Young Krusty: Blah, blah, blah, blah, Moses! Blah, blah, blah, blah some prayer!
Young Krusty: (SUBDUED KRUSTY LAUGH) Good evening. Tonight my guest is AFL-CIO chairman George Meany, who will be discussing collective bargaining agreements.
Young Krusty: Let me be blunt. Is there a labor crisis in America today?
Young Krusty: (SINGS) WHO'S OUR FAVORITE TV CLOWN WHO LIKES TO CLOWN AROUND / K-R-U...
Young Krusty: (SNAPPING) Hey! Quit steppin' on my solo, ya creepy little show monkeys!
Young Krusty: (SOMBER) Hey-hey. Scary world. They start with the "A" bomb, then skipped right to the "H" bomb. These "geniuses" can blow up the planet, but they don't know the alphabet!
Young Krusty: (CHUCKLES) There wasn't a dry turtleneck in the house.
Young Krusty: I don't want to play in Peoria. They're always doing construction on Highway Seventy-four.
Young Krusty: How do I do that?
Young Krusty: (EXAGGERATED PAINED NOISES)
Young Krusty: (BACK IN HIS SEAT) Wow. This is the best kind of comedy of all: cheap.
Young Krusty: There's only one thing I want. (ZANY) Ice for my ding-dong! (SUAVE) And you.
Young Krusty: Actually, sweetheart... it's the end. I'm leaving you for Ron Rabinowitz at United Parasites.
Young Krusty: I can only tell the truth right after sex. But all during sex I was thinking it.
Young Krusty: Deuteronomy? Isn't that the study of deuters?
Teenage Homer: Stay with me, Marge, and I promise we'll travel the world... and perhaps outer space. (MAKES WEIRD SCI-FI NOISE)
Teenage Homer: Hey, Professor Von Hubba-hubba! Wanna hop in my dune bug and erode some beach?
Teenage Homer: Come on, baby. The only math you need is you plus me equals forever.
Teenage Homer: (THOUGHTFUL) Half-day, eh?
Teenage Homer: (READING STIFFLY FROM CARDS) My fellow Wildcats... My name is Homer Simpson. (TOO BIG) There are many reasons why I... uh... I... I... (STOPS, THEN) You know what?
Teenage Homer: (DRAMATIC) I spent all night working on that speech, but now I realize the best thing to do is speak from my heart.
Teenage Homer: So... uh... I feel that... (STARTING UP, BIG) fellow Wildcats... (PANICKY NOISE)
Teenage Homer: (READING THE SCRAPS OF PAPER) Um... "Webster's defines"... um... "in the words of Ted Nugent"... "school spirit"... "next card"... "the future"...
Teenage Homer: No fair!
Teenage Homer: (STROKES CHIN, THEN:) "Color My World," "Disco Sucks" and Butthead the Goat.
Teenage Homer: (SERIOUS) They're too big to fail.
Teenage Homer: (HAPPY HUMMING)
Teenage Homer: Uh, uh, no, I'm, uh... just exploring my body!
Teenage Homer: Oh, hair. I'll love you when you're old and gray.
Teenage Homer: Huh... (MAD) well, two can play at that game!
Teenage Homer: Who are you?
Teenage Homer: (LOSING IT) Why you little...
Teenage Homer: It was love at first sight, and you ruined it!
Teenage Homer: (MAD) What do you know?
Teenage Homer: You're lookin' at him.
Teenage Homer: You're the idiot.
Teenage Homer: Don't act like I'm the first person that ever said that!
Teenage Homer: Shut up and go to the prom with me!
Teenage Homer: C'mere!
Teenage Homer: (MENACING) Stupid kid. Steals my future. Well I'm going to...ice cream, with cookie dough?!
Teenage Homer: (IMPRESSED) ...unnecessarily big TVs?!
Teenage Homer: ..."Thursday Night Football?!" (STICKS FINGER IN AIR) And the globe feels so warm -- I am in awe of the future!
Teenage Homer: Okay, that's not so great.
Teenage Homer: I've met some jive turkeys in the seventies but that turkey's the jivest.
Teenage Homer: I've traveled through space and time to make Marge settle for me because she doesn't know better.
Teenage Homer: I've gotta ask, what happened? (GESTURES TO PRESENT-DAY HOMER) Was I in a forest fire or something?
Teenage Marge: (INTRIGUED) What's his name again?
Teenage Marge: (FLATTERED) Oh, Homie.
Teenage Marge: Promenade? With you? Forget it, bub!
Teenage Bart: Could you please stop fighting in front of us?
Teenage Bart: Jenda, I think we're ready to go all the way.
Teenage Bart: Jenda, that's not what I meant.
Teenage Bart: (SINCERE) I love you. Will you marry me?
Teenage Bart: I've got it all figured out! You can waitress while I learn to cut meat. We'll live in a trailer, but to avoid paying for parking, I'll drive while you sleep. We'll never, ever stop!
Teenage Bart: When?
Teenage Bart: (GLUM) So that's how Jenda dumped me.
Teenage Bart: No, Mom dumped you 'cause you blew all our money on this underwater house.
Teenage Bart: So... what do you do to kill time in here?
Teenage Bart: (YELLS OVER NOISE) Why'd you buy the first hover car ever made? Didn't you know it'd take time to work out the kinks?
Teenage Bart: (AGHAST) Dad, that's my fourth grade teacher!
Teenage Bart: Hi, Mrs. K. This is sure weird, huh?
Teenage Bart: Uh, I... don't think so.
Teenage Bart: (SIGHS) I wish I could talk to my fourth grade self just once. I'd say "work hard, don't be such a screw up."
Teenage Bart: This time is so precious -- don't waste it!
Teenage Bart: No. He activated his self-destruct mechanism.
Teenage Bart: Love can really be painful.
Teenage Bart: How'd he take it?
Teenage Bart: (GLUM) I guess everyone in this family is doomed to wind up alone.
Teenage Bart: A career? No problem, I speak three languages.
Teenage Bart: Oh yeah?
Teenage Bart: When Jenda hears about my great new career, she'll definitely take me back.
Teenage Bart: (SAD) Yes, Mr. Gheet.
Teenage Bart: Which one? Radioactive, smallpox, eternal midnight...
Teenage Bart: (HUGE GASP)
Teenage Bart: (BITTERLY) Oh, I get it. You can't tip me because your hands are tied. My Dad pulls that scam all the time.
Teenage Bart: Uh... with the diamond?
Teenage Bart: (TO BURNS) I can't take your scholarship! It's going to my sister. It would break her heart.
Teenage Bart: They do?
Teenage Bart: Mr. Smithers? I thought you were... you know... a...
Teenage Bart: Listen, Lis, I've gotta tell you something. (BEAT) I'm going to Yale.
Teenage Bart: Then I've got some great news! You're not going to Yale!
Teenage Bart: (ANNOYED) What?
Teenage Bart: Why don't you mail it to your butt?
Teenage Bart: Hey, Nelson. What's up with your girlfriends?
Teenage Bart: I'd better go talk to him.
Teenage Bart: Cheer up, Milhouse. You got your whole life ahead of you.
Teenage Bart: Hey, I remember when you were a nerdy little fourth-grader. And now you're an emotionally crippled mini-Hulk. What girl wouldn't want that?
Teenage Bart: I guess so.
Teenage Bart: Oh, I was just thinking about Milhouse and Lisa.
Teenage Bart: (EXCITED) Hey, that rundown old house looks familiar! That's where Doc Frink used to live!
Teenage Bart: This machine lets us look into the future. Wouldn't that be romantic?
Teenage Bart: Totally. Right after I fiddle with these dials and levers.
Teenage Bart: I can't let that happen. I gotta go.
Teenage Bart: Nooooo!!!!!
Teenage Bart: Keeping Lisa from destroying her life!
Teenage Bart: Look, I'm not taking the scholarship. You're the one who deserves to go to Yale.
Teenage Bart: Hey, I'm waiting 'til I find a girl who likes me for me.
Teenage Lisa: So Nelson, who did you end up bringing tonight? Sherri or Terri?
Teenage Milhouse: Sorry I'm late, Lisa. I was at the gym, totally gunning my lats. Just gunning 'em!
Teenage Milhouse: (WORRIED) Oh man! The deposit on this tux was two hundred Reagans!
Teenage Milhouse: Really. C-can I kiss you?
Teenage Milhouse: No. But it's really hard 'cause I'm on an all-onion diet.
Teenage Milhouse: (ENRAGED) What are you doing?
Teenage Milhouse: Come on, let her destroy it!
Teenage Milhouse: Lenny! Carl! Can you pull me out?
Adult Bart: Lousy sheriff. Run me out of town. He's lost my vote.
Adult "Bart": (SMOOTH VOICE) And you two are ten-year-old versions of me!
Adult "Bart": The three of us could create quite a lot of mischief, but I have to fly back to New York. That's where my wife and I live.
Adult "Bart": That's her. You wanna see pictures of our kids?
Adult Bart: How could you possibly need all these clothes?
Adult Bart: Meh.
Adult Bart: You're two weeks late on the rent, Bart. Not to mention that geography report from thirty years ago.
Adult Bart: (TO SKINNER) Don't worry, I got some buyers coming over to look at my good kidney.
Adult Bart: They grow back, right?
Adult Bart: You mean, evicted?
Adult Bart: Transporter engaged.
Adult Bart: (AGGRAVATED NOISE) Now what?
Adult Bart: Mom, don't make us go to Dad's!
Adult Bart: It smells like dog but there's no dog.
Adult Bart: You know, I can hear everything you say during "cross phase." What are you doin' here?
Adult Bart: You're wrong! This is gonna be your best Christmas ever!
Adult Bart: Yeah, give me some credit.
Adult Bart: (SNEAKY CHUCKLE) I'll just dump them at my Mom's.
Adult Bart: Dammit!
Adult Bart: (A LITTLE SLURRED) Did ya bake any?
Adult Bart: (FRUSTRATED) Oh man. I can't believe they still haven't figured out a way to detangle Christmas lights.
Adult Bart: (SARCASTIC) Well, maybe Mom should marry him.
Adult Bart: Your mother remarried?!
Adult Bart: Dad, can you take the boys out for a while? I don't feel so good.
Adult Bart: (SIGHS, THEN TO SELF) I can't believe she got married and I have no one. It's so hard to find somebody new.
Adult Bart: Hey, Lis.
Adult Bart: Wanna come up?
Adult Bart: (TIPSY) Nelson calls you?
Adult Bart: The boys think I'm a lousy father.
Adult Bart: (HUGE LAUGH, THEN:) Sorry.
Adult Bart: Yes I did and they were some of the best cookies ever made in this house, but that is not the point!
Adult Bart: Well... Mom kept her hands off you and you turned out great!
Adult Bart: (PLEASED) You think so?
Adult Bart: Maybe it's the court-mandated sincerity chip I've got in my brain. But Lis... you're the person I always wanted to be.
Adult Bart: I gotta reconnect with those boys.
Adult Bart: Back in position! (CLAPS TWICE)
Adult Bart: Hey guys, you wanna watch Krusty?
Adult Bart: Only the funniest man in the world!
Adult Bart: Where's Dad?
Adult Bart: How can he be such a cool grandfather when he's such a lousy father?
Adult Bart: Dad, where'd you take my boys?
Adult Bart: (GROANS) It's Chief Wiggum!
Adult Bart: Hey, Ralph, I heard you died.
Adult Bart: Wow, this place hasn't changed a bit.
Adult Bart: Was my Dad here?
Adult Bart: Yeah. Since he don't drink, he just comes here to see Lenny and Carl.
Adult Bart: Hey Lenny.
Adult Bart: Right. What was the point again?
Adult Bart: (CATCHES BREATH, THEN SAYS:) Boys, I have acted like a ten-year-old for the last thirty years, and I swear to you: I will grow up and act like a twenty-year-old, the way a divorced forty-year-old should.
Adult Bart: (SINCERE, SAD) Boys, I'm a deadbeat Dad, I live in a school, it's Christmas... the only thing worth anything in my life is you.
Adult Bart: Hmm, funny how they evolved and we didn't.
Adult Bart: (TO CAMERA) Everything I know about women can be summed up by a jump-rope rhyme: "Girls go to Mars to buy candy bars, boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider." Except I didn't have to go to Jupiter to get stupider.
Adult Bart: I had a bigger ball of gas I could study.
Adult Bart: So the closest thing I had to an adult male role model were the schoolyard bullies.
Adult Bart: You get the picture. Perfect girl. (IMITATING WOODY ALLEN) So like a schmuck, I treat her like day-old matzo. (SMALL COUGH)
Adult Bart: At that moment, I had a vision of every time in my life an angry woman would say "Everything's fine."
Adult Bart: (SADLY) I guess it's just me and the dog.
Adult Bart: (SAD NOISE)
Adult Bart: And that's when I learned Cupid was just a fat naked jerk with an arrow.
Adult Bart: Love? What is it? What does it mean? How do you spell it? No one knows. Fortunately, there is a cure -- any videogame ever made.
Adult Bart: (SAD SIGH) Married?
Adult Bart: (HOPEFUL GASP)
Adult Bart: Hey, what did I do?
Adult Bart: So Dad, what do you think of my place?
Adult Bart: Okay guys, time for you to go to your mother's.
Adult Bart: Here's your mom's house.
Adult Bart: (SIGHS) Hi, Jerry.
Adult Bart: Great, great. So I guess you and Jenda are still together. Is she there?
Adult Bart: No.
Adult Bart: (AGGRAVATED NOISE)
Adult Bart: Dad, if ever I needed fatherly wisdom, it's now.
Adult Bart: (SIGHS) I miss my kids.
Adult Bart: Isn't your Mom eighty-seven?
Adult Bart: I don't know how that happened in a senate with ninety-nine Democrats.
Adult Bart: I don't think I'm ready for this, man.
Adult Bart: Well, that didn't look so hard.
Adult Bart: (SUAVELY) You know at my job, I satisfy ladies even bigger than you.
Adult Bart: Um, I feed dinosaurs?
Adult Bart: One please.
Adult Bart: Man, that's some targeted advertising!
Adult Bart: How long does this take?
Adult Bart: Wow! It works! I'm completely over my ex-wife!
Adult Bart: Do you take wedding bands as tips?
Adult Bart: Ay carumba! I have moved on!
Adult Bart: Nothing to worry about.
Adult Bart: He's been frozen like that for days.
Adult Bart: So... was it good for you?
Adult Bart: Oh my God! We went home with you?!
Adult Bart: You know -- Dad really misses you.
Adult Bart: Look, maybe I shouldn't have done this, but I've got him right here.
Adult Bart: Sorry, I must have recorded over Dad. But admit it. When you thought it was Dad, you were excited.
Adult Bart: Hey Homer, your robot body finally came.
Adult Bart: You boys look happy.
Adult Bart: He's the fool. You're great.
Adult Bart: I don't have to say anything. Believe me, no guy wants to see his ex looking hot or being sweet. Makes him realize everything he's lost.
Adult Bart: Hey Dad, can you watch the boys?
Adult Bart: You know, this was a great evening.
Adult Bart: Man, when is that voice gonna change?
Adult Bart: But they brought us little cakes and...
Adult Bart: (GETTING IT) Ohh.
Adult Bart: (IN HEAVEN) Ay carumba.
Adult Bart: One of us has to stay home with you guys. And your mom can't quit her job at Google.
Adult Bart: (ENTERTAINING AUDIENCE) Now, will somebody hold up a one dollar bill?
Adult Bart: Uh-oh. It looks like we woke someone up from her nap.
Adult Bart: Well, now that you're up, you can do your juggling act.
Adult Bart: Now enjoy the majesty of our prehistoric past!
Adult Bart: (EXCITED) Yes!
Adult Bart: What? Me? Now that's crazy!
Adult Bart: Well, you're not paying attention to me -- you're texting!
Adult Bart: If I wasn't paying attention, then how did I notice you not paying attention to my not paying attention? (CHECKMATE) Ha!
Adult Bart: They are! You're four years older!
Adult Bart: (VERY LONG) Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
Adult Bart: A tall beer and no judgmental women.
Adult Bart: What are you doing here?
Adult Bart: Until I was eight I thought he was a magical gorilla.
Adult Bart: Or my divorce.
Adult Bart: So, Jenda, I don't know what love is, but I know what it isn't. And we're "isn't."
Adult Bart: What?! (ANNOYED GROAN, THEN CALMING) You know what, Jenda? I'm not even mad. Because I am finally, completely, over you.
Adult Bart: Wait -- what am I doing back here?
Adult Bart: (CONFUSED) Uh... you should look at my profile.
Adult Bart: So, you're sure I'm cured? No more feelings for my ex-wife?
Homer's Brain: Tell a lie. Tell a lie.
Adult Bart: Lis, I hope things work out with you and Milhouse, but if they don't, I know just where you should go.
Adult Bart: Even though he's not a zombie anymore?
Adult Bart: Well done, Dad.
Adult Bart: Soon.
Adult Lisa: (AGGRAVATED NOISE) How did my daughter turn into my brother?
Adult Lisa: (SWEETLY) You parked the car. That helped.
Adult Lisa: Maybe my Mom would have some ideas...
Adult Lisa: You could go back to Michigan -- it's still under Sharia law.
Adult Lisa: She told me to relax and bake cookies!
Adult Lisa: Oh, isn't that a little dangerous?
Adult Lisa: Eh, why not?
Adult Lisa: (TIPSY) Should I have married Nelson? (LOUD WHISPER) 'Cause we still talk on the phone.
Adult Lisa: Well... (GUILTY) someone calls someone.
Adult Lisa: (VERY SINCERE) Oh, poor Bart. My daughter thinks I'm a lousy mother.
Adult Lisa: Butt out.
Adult Lisa: This is it. I'm going into the ultranet to save my daughter.
Adult Lisa: (PASSING OUT NOISE)
Adult Lisa: Lisa Simpson, the following people want to friend you.
Adult Lisa: (PRESSING BUTTONS) Ignore, ignore, ignore... Ooh, Martin Prince is now "Marcia Princess?" (SLIGHT GIGGLE, THEN DETERMINED) No, I've got to find Zia.
Adult Lisa: Not a good time.
Adult Lisa: Now, where is the Google door?
Adult Lisa: Oh right, it's Dr. Seuss's birthday.
Adult Lisa: I'd just throw in the towel and make it a state.
Adult Lisa: (SOUTHERN FOR SOME REASON) Okay honey, I made you pork chops just like you like 'em -- twenty.
Adult Lisa: (MUFFLED SCREAM)
Adult Lisa: (MILDLY IRRITATED) As I told you when we talked last month, I've been doing a lot of charity work for the undead.
Adult Lisa: (SAD) Are you sure?
Homer's Brain: (QUICKLY) Don't tell him. Give him a fake name.
Homer's Brain: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer's Brain: Don't you get it? You gotta use a reverse psychology.
Homer's Brain: Okay. Don't use reverse psychology.
Homer's Brain: (THINKS) Donald Trump? No. Arnold Palmer? No. Bill Cosby? No.
Homer's Brain: (SARCASTIC) Bravo! (WEAK APPLAUSE)
Homer's Brain: Uh-oh. I don't understand a word he's saying. Why doesn't he just let me bat? I wish I was home with a big bag of potato chips... Mmm potato chips.
Homer's Brain: I want some peanuts.
Homer's Brain: Don't tell him you were at a bar! (GASPS) But what else is open at night?
Homer's Brain: (CHUCKLES) I would'a never thought of that.
Homer's Brain: What does that mean? Better say something or they'll think you're stupid.
Homer's Brain: (PROUDLY) Swish!
Homer's Brain: I thought this thing was going to be catered. Boy, am I hungry. (GETTING CHOKED UP) I mean I'm really, really hungry.
Homer's Brain: Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart!
Homer's Brain: Don't say revenge. Don't say revenge.
Homer's Brain: That's it, I'm getting outta here.
Homer's Brain: "Special Day?" Oh, what have I forgotten now? Now, don't panic... Is it Bacon Day? No, that's crazy talk... She's getting impatient, take a stab at it.
Homer's Brain: Little do they know, I'm ducking out early to take the Duff Brewery tour.
Homer's Brain: (SMUGLY) Heh, heh, heh, they don't suspect a thing. (THEN, BRIGHTLY) Well, off to the plant.
Homer's Brain: Uh-oh. Did I say that or just think it?
Homer's Brain: Don't think about beer.
Homer's Brain: Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?
Homer's Brain: Wait a minute. Is he coming on to me?
Homer's Brain: Oh my God, he is coming on to me.
Homer's Brain: Yikes!
Homer's Brain: Oh man, I've really got to go to the bathroom. Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?
Homer's Brain: This is it, Homer. It's time to tell her the terrible secret from your past.
Homer's Brain: No, the other secret.
Homer's Brain: Don't panic. Just come up with a good story.
Homer's Brain: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Homer's Brain: Twenty dollars can buy many peanuts.
Homer's Brain: Money can be exchanged for goods and services.
Homer's Brain: Wait. Are you sure that's how this sort of thing works?
Homer's Brain: Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts!
Homer's Brain: (READING) "You will find happiness with a new love." (DEPRESSED: EATING COOKIE) Oh, even the Chinese are against me. (SAD SIGH) What's the point. I can't fight fate.
Homer's Brain: Mental note: "The girl knows too much."
Homer's Brain: Something was said: not good. What was it? "Don't yell at Homer." No, that's okay. What was it? "Slow." They called you "slow!"
Homer's Brain: Something said: not good...
Homer's Brain: (CHANTING) Eatthepuddingeatthepudding eatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthepuddingeatthe pudding.
Homer's Brain: Think unsexy thoughts. Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts!
Homer's Brain: (READING) "You will find happiness with a new love."
Homer's Brain: Quiet! It might be you. I can't remember.
Homer's Brain: No, no! Why embarrass us both? Just write a check and I'll release some more endorphins.
Homer's Brain: (SLIGHTLY HURT) I've worked here for ten years, and my boss doesn't even know my name? (THEN RESOLUTE) Well, that's gonna change right now. (LOUD) My name is Homer J. Simp--
Homer's Brain: I'm a big four-eyed lame-o and I wear the same stupid sweater every day, and...
Homer's Brain: Silence you fool! It can be ours.
Homer's Brain: (AWED) Oh glory of glories! Oh heavenly testament to the eternal majesty of God's creation!
Homer's Brain: Now she'll really be surprised when she opens that ironing board cover!
Homer's Brain: There it is, Homer: the cleverest thing you'll ever say. And nobody heard it.
Homer's Brain: Mental note: steal his idea.
Homer's Brain: (SLIGHTLY SLURRED) That cactus is right. (RALLYING, HEAD CLEARING) I've only got one chance. I got to knock him out.
Homer's Brain: (BORED MOAN) You can stay, but I'm leaving.
Homer's Brain: Quiet, you fool. You're on the one team that can't possibly be fired.
Homer's Brain: Mmm. Look at his eyes. He's trying to hypnotize me, but not in the good Las Vegas way.
Homer's Brain: Oh, you don't want to know what I really think. Now, look sad and say "D'oh."
Homer's Brain: You're leaving the arm there too long! You wanna make it worse?!
Homer's Brain: (FREAKING) No, no! He'll know you're on to him -- quick, shake his hand!
Homer's Brain: (URGENT PROMPTING) As...? As...?!
Homer's Brain: Just don't bump me on your way out of the car.
Homer's Brain: Keep looking shocked and move slowly towards the cake.
Homer's Brain: I've already gone this far... I wonder what my life would be like if I robbed the Kwik-E- Mart?
Homer's Brain: No! Must resist temptation!
Homer's Brain: Bo-ring.
Homer's Brain: Wow. That saxophone would make a great pipe.
Homer's Brain: Don't you get it? They're using us as patsies to make the Army look good.
Homer's Brain: A cookie! No, a car! No, a cookie!
Homer's Brain: I'm not thinking. You think.
Homer's Brain: (MOCKING VOICE) You have to think, it's your job.
Homer's Brain: You idiot! Mr. Fatso is you!
Homer's Brain: That's right, numbskull! Your son's made a fool of you in front of the whole town!
Homer's Brain: (TIPSY BUT BELLICOSE) Well, I'll fix you. Go drive a car!
Homer's Brain: (COMPLETELY ASTOUNDED) What the hell are you doing?!
Homer's Brain: I'm doing the best with what I got! All you feed me is reality shows!
Homer's Brain: (MOANS) I really wish I had fixed that faucet.
Homer's Brain: Okay Homer, don't speak. If you must make a sound, whistle.
Homer's Brain: When your wife looks at you, full of hope, with an idea that would destroy life as we know it...
Homer's Brain: Just smile, nod... and stall, stall, stall...
Homer's Brain: ...until she changes her mind.
Homer's Brain: (EXCITED) All right! "Try it" means sex.
Homer's Brain: Okay, Homer. This is the moment of truth. You've gotta tell Marge you really don't want another kid.
Homer's Brain: Eh, how bad could it be?
Homer's Brain: Uh-oh. She's picked names? Who puts this much thought into having a baby? Stall, stall, stall!
Homer's Brain: There he is. The fat, pathetic slob I'd be with four kids.
Homer's Brain: (VERY RELIEVED NOISE) Oh, right. That dad was there all along. Phew. That was so sweet! Maybe there's no such thing as too many kids.
Homer's Brain: Don't blow the surprise. Pretend you forgot.
Homer's Brain: Uh-oh. If you're honest, you'll have to tell her about the train!
Homer's Brain: (STUNNED) How stupid are you?
Homer's Brain: Just for that I'm not going to help you.
Homer's Brain: (SCOLDS) Homer Simpson! Do you really want to keep cheating your friends, lying to your wife, and avoiding your kids? What would Jesus do?
Homer's Brain: This simulation has been brought to you by your brain, a subsidiary of your penis.
Homer's Thoughts: Marge thinks Flanders is annoying. This marriage just got interesting.
Homer's Thoughts: (CHUCKLE) She's so cute...
Homer's Thoughts: Wow. Bart has feelings. (CHUCKLES) Mrs. Doody.
Homer's Thoughts: (GASP) No cops in sight. If I'm gonna save that clerk, I'm gonna have to take the law into my own hands again.
Homer's Thoughts: Lord, this is a dire emergency. If you could fix my house, or make a new house from one of my ribs...
Homer's Thoughts: Now for that happy period between the lie and the time it's found out. (CHUCKLES)
Homer's Thoughts: (SADLY) Mirror mirror on the wall: who's the baldest of them all?
Homer's Thoughts: Gee, I thought I had a bigger package than that.
Homer's Thoughts: Don't worry -- they're just friends. There's nothing physical between them.
Homer's Thoughts: Uh-oh! I'm gonna have to work on my marriage. Or, alternatively...
Homer's Thoughts: Wait a minute. These guys don't know me. I can be whatever I want.
Homer's Thoughts: She's right, it was all me!
Homer's Thoughts: Oh man, what do I do? (EXCITED GASP) Wait -- the book Marge gave me!
Homer's Thoughts: No book is gonna make my daughter sad. Time to do what I do best: lie to a child.
Homer's Thoughts: It's poison! Whatever you do, don't eat it.
Homer's Thoughts: Okay, you're already eating it, but don't finish it. Okay, you finished it, but don't ask for--
Homer's Thoughts: You moron! Just kill her!
Homer's Thoughts: Play it cool, Homer. Don't let her know it's perfect.
Homer's Thoughts: A million dollars -- now I'm really glad I didn't die!
Homer's Thoughts: Wait... if I tell Marge I won, she'll know I was buying the ticket when I was supposed to be onstage with her. (MOAN) I'm rich and I can't even tell my own wife!
Homer's Thoughts: Calm down, Homer. Calm down.
Homer's Thoughts: Got to stay mad. The next morning is where the fight is won or lost.
Homer's Thoughts: I'm buying it!
Homer's Thoughts: Okay, just imagine she's a Bond girl.
Homer's Thoughts: (BIGGER MOAN) Judi Dench?!
Homer's Thoughts: Oh my God... is she flirting with me?
Homer's Thoughts: She is flirting with me. Okay, Homer, let her down easy. Don't go breaking any hearts.
Homer's Thoughts: (HORRIFIED REALIZATION) Grampa?!
Homer's Thoughts: No I haven't!
Homer's Thoughts: Oh my God, Marge is here! What is she thinking now?
Homer's Thoughts: (SNORTS) You have regrets, Mr. "I Get To See The Weathergirl From The Side?" I made the worst financial decision of all time. Oh, I can't think about it, I won't think about it, I don't want to think about it...
Homer's Thoughts: Don't eat it. It's been in his ear. Don't eat it. It's been in his ear.
Homer's Thoughts: Don't eat it. It's been in the boy's ear and the dog's mouth. Don't eat it.
Homer's Thoughts: Finally. Time for the big bump-into.
Homer's Thoughts: (THOUGHTFUL) Wednesday?
Homer's Thoughts: Okay, she's always in a good mood after therapy...
Homer's Thoughts: Except that you're about to double-cross some gangsters.
Homer's Thoughts: She'll forgive me...
Homer's Thoughts: Especially this time...
Homer's Thoughts: I mean it's Christmas...
Homer's Thoughts: I wonder if there's birds on the moon. (SUDDENLY SOBS) I miss Marge. (SOBS MORE)
Homer's Thoughts: Whoa, he's getting serious. Is this what I really want?
Marge's Thoughts: I should say something reassuring yet noncommittal.
Marge's Thoughts: (SMALL GASP) We've got a winning hand. We can take the rest of the tricks!
Marge's Thoughts: (WARY) Ooh, you'd better be careful. The purpose of this game is to make friends. You don't make friends by winning.
Marge's Thoughts: (POSITIVE, ENCOURAGING) Still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner.
Marge's Thoughts: Don't ask me, I'm just hair. Your head stopped eighteen inches ago.
Marge's Thoughts: (FRUSTRATED SIGH) This place is so boring. If somebody doesn't do something interesting, I'm gonna have to. But what?
Marge's Thoughts: How much money did he piss away on this?
Marge's Thoughts: (HAPPILY) This sure beats slaving over a hot stove!
Marge's Thoughts: Where is he?! Where is he?!
Marge's Thoughts: He cares so much about those doggone dugongs. I wish I felt that kind of passion. Maybe I should join him on his mission...
Marge's Thoughts: Darn these long bank lines. Although it does give me a moment with my thoughts. (BEAT) Darn these long bank lines.
Marge's Thoughts: Hm... could this show help me with eating cheating?
Marge's Thoughts: Hm, the kids are acting awfully strange. Maybe I should sit down with them and-- (OUT LOUD, SUSPICIOUS) Homer, where are you going?!
Marge's Thoughts: (LUSTFUL NOISES) Gosh, what a hunk!
Marge's Thoughts: That'll stop her from seeing him. (SATISFIED MURMUR)
Marge's Thoughts: I know what Homer's thinking. He's thinking that he really wants a baby now. So this should be the time, ironically, that I'll change my mind and not want one. (BEAT) Well, no way! I want one more than ever! (DETERMINED NOISE)
Marge's Thoughts: Man, things sure have turned to crap.
Bart's Thoughts: She's beautiful. Say somethin' clever.
Bart's Thoughts: Now just relax. For once you didn't do anything wrong. Just explain yourself and everyone will understand.
Bart's Thoughts: They love me. I'm accepted. I don't need this mask anymore.
Bart's Thoughts: That doesn't sound like me. Could it be the drug kicking in? I am feeling an urge to straighten up and fly right...
Bart's Thoughts: This test is boring. What else is on?
Bart's Thoughts: (GRIMLY) Time to get rid of the competition.
Bart's Thoughts: Oh man, I must be the first guy who was ever pressured into marriage.
Bart's Thoughts: She had more curves than a Hot Wheels track. Well, she didn't yet, but she would after puberty.
Bart's Thoughts: Gotta stop that letter!
Bart's Thoughts: Okay, this is it. Do or die.
Bart's Thoughts: A girl who likes candy? Wow.
Lisa's Thoughts: That'll learn `im to bust my tomater.
Lisa's Thoughts: They're only using you for your pool, you know.
Lisa's Thoughts: (SMUGLY) Well, well, well. Look who's come crawlin' back.
Lisa's Thoughts: Uh-oh. Should I laugh? Was that dry British wit? Or subtle self-pity? Ooh, they're staring at me, better respond.
Lisa's Thoughts: Scanning for sarcasm... it's clean. Go!
Lisa's Thoughts: I'm dizzy! I'm nauseous! Oh, but I'm popular! (STILL LAUGHING)
Lisa's Thoughts: He's not like anybody I've ever met. He's like a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a vest. (BEAT) He sure is ugly, though. (BEAT) So why can't I stop staring at him?
Lisa's Thoughts: Oh, no... I think I'm getting a crush on Nelson Muntz!
Lisa's Thoughts: (HAPPY GASP) My first kiss! I always wondered what it would be like!
Lisa's Thoughts: (REASSURING) Oh, I know. I heard it too. Here's some music.
Lisa's Thoughts: (RELIEVED SIGH) This is kind of relaxing. But it's so hard to turn off my brain. I have to stop thinking... starting now. (BEAT) Hey, it worked. (CHUCKLE) Oh no, that's thinking!
Lisa's Thoughts: Ohh, it's a ball of yarn. That's funny, I feel like batting it around.
Lisa's Thoughts: (SURPRISED NOISE) I have a paw!
Lisa's Thoughts: Oh my gosh, I've entered the body of our cat!
Lisa's Thoughts: Beh! Mag-gie! Hey, hey, get your sticky hands off me. Owww!
Lisa's Thoughts: (SCREAM)
Lisa's Thoughts: Oh, yuck! That sandwich is full of meat. There's bacon, (WITH GROWING RELISH) Canadian bacon, Mexican bacon... (HOMER-LIKE SHUDDER)
Lisa's Thoughts: (SHUDDER) ...and a mouth-watering veal chop.
Lisa's Thoughts: Oh, no. Now I'm Dad.
Lisa's Thoughts: (A LA HOMER, GROANS) And I'm at a stupid, boring ballet. (YAWNS)
Lisa's Thoughts: (SNORING)
Lisa's Thoughts: (JERKING AWAKE, GROGGY) Whuh?
Lisa's Thoughts: (REFLECTED IN LISA'S EYES) I'm sorry, honey.
Lisa's Thoughts: Geez, why is Lisa so mad at me? I only came to this dump so I could be with her. And, what happened to my big sandwich?
Lisa's Thoughts: (SNORING)
Lisa's Thoughts: These girls are brilliant! I finally found kids I can relate to.
Lisa's Thoughts: Wow, I'm actually passing as a college student! And they don't have a Blue's Clue. (CATCHES HERSELF) Whoops, gotta age it up.
Lisa's Thoughts: (SIGH OF RELIEF)
Lisa's Thoughts: (SIGH) I'm in a coffee house listening to poetry! There's a cat on a table and no one seems to care! This is the single greatest day of my life.
Lisa's Thoughts: (REALIZING) Oh my God, my social studies project is due tomorrow morning!
Lisa's Thoughts: (OVERJOYED) Oh my God, I was wrong! And by being corrected, I learned! And no one cared about my feelings!
Lisa's Thoughts: Okay, I can talk my way out of this.
Lisa's Thoughts: A fight? That would mean rejecting the last part of me that's still a girl.
Lisa's Thoughts: Okay, I'll do it. But whom should I beat up?
Lisa's Thoughts: They're looking at me! All right, Lisa -- time to show these jazz legends how we swing in the suburbs.
Lisa's Thoughts: Why did I have to lie about my heritage? By speaking with forked tongue I am in heap big trouble. (REALIZING, EVEN MORE ALARMED) And now I'm thinking in stereotypes? That's even worse!
Lisa's Thoughts: Question two: Using what you learned in question one...
Lisa's Thoughts: You can do it, Lisa. There's nothing in the room but you and the test.
Lisa's Thoughts: Focus!
Lisa's Thoughts: Maybe I should just move on to question two.
Lisa's Thoughts: Oh my God, you've been challenged! Well Lisa, let's see how you respond.
Lisa's Thoughts: (SMUG CHUCKLE) Here it comes.
Lisa's Thoughts: But then... you wound up like you.
Lisa's Thoughts: Those girls are snotty and shallow. Tell them off!
Lisa's Thoughts: (MAD) You'd better hope they say yes!
Lisa's Thoughts: (GASP) Is it possible I've met a teacher who doesn't like me?!
Lisa's Thoughts: Aw, he's sweet. What am I doing? He's just Ralph with a dream. The dream of not Ralphing. But I'm sure I could totally change and fix him.
Lisa's Thoughts: Wow, I made Mom cry. What unimaginable power! I can use this to get anything I want. (CHOKING UP) But right now, all I want is for Mom to stop crying.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: --of a man.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (ALTERNATING WITH EVERY LETTER) A-B-C-D-E-F-G- (RAPID FIRE) H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Like we go to a movie theater and pay full price! That would be (VERY LOUD) awesome!!!
Kirk Voice Milhouse: What? Now I'm not pulling it off?
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Hello, Lisa. This is my Daddy... I mean, um, Kirk Van Houten. May I speak to your father, please?
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Homer, Bart would like to spend the night at our house, and he has my permission.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (BARKING IT OUT) Not so fast!
Kirk Voice Milhouse: I also want to say that Bart is a remarkable boy, and I disapprove of your fathering and of your fat stomach.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Give him anything he wants -- bigger allowance, a new bike -- just do it.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: And in ten years, make Lisa go to the prom with Milhouse.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Now I want you to eat a gallon of ice cream in under two minutes.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: You now have one minute, fifty-five seconds.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: I'm gonna like being an adult.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: I love when you buy me clothes! You know what's itchy and what's not.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (SCARED NOISE) I'd give you all money but my wallet is velcroed too tight!
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (TO BART, PLEASED) An adult! He's buyin' it!
Kirk Voice Milhouse: I want to buy this beer, uh, cigarettes, magazines with boobs, and three pairs of sunglasses...
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Hey bartender. We'd like two milks and then you can tell us where babies come from.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (DRAMATIC) Hello, Lisa.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (COY) Milhouse? Who's Milhouse? (COVERING) I mean, he's my son.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (DRAMATIC) Then I will be your guys' dad!
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Um, as adults, what do we do now? Shake hands?
Kirk Voice Milhouse: And that's how you do it. (PLEASED NOISE)
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Young man, apologize to your sister.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (FURIOUS) Why you little...
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Kids, let me handle this. (TO P.R. PERSON) Uh, we'd like it in singles and nickels, please.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (SCARED) In cursive?
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (SCARED) In cursive?
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (NERVOUS LAUGH) Oh, I'm single. Though some days I have a girl buddy on field trips.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: (SHRUGS) You're the adult.
Kirk Voice Milhouse: Yeah. For my Thomas the Tank engines.

Todd Flanders: Meri Kurimasu. I am Hotseiosha, a Japanese priest who acts like Santa Claus. I have eyes in the back of my head so children better behave when I'm nearby.

Patty Bouvier: Marge, please.
Homer Simpson: It's your sister.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Hello.
Homer Simpson: What? Why? Oh, yeah. (FORCED POLITENESS) Hello Patty, hello Selma. How was your trip?
Marge Simpson: (READS) "Dear friends of the Simpson family: We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First the sadness. Our little cat, Snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat, Snowball II...so I guess life goes on. Speaking of life going on, Grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself. Lisa got straight A's, and Bart, well... we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all..."
Homer Simpson: (MAD) Marge, haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?
Marge Simpson: (CONTINUES) "...Homer sends his love. Happy Holidays."
Homer Simpson: Marge!
Marge Simpson: (CONTINUES) "The Simpsons."
Homer Simpson: (MAD) Marge, where's the extension cord?
Marge Simpson: Oh, for heavens sakes, Homer. It's in the utility drawer.
Homer Simpson: Sorry. I'm just a big kid and I love Christmas so much.
Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLING) ...Every year.
Marge Simpson: All right, children. Let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole.
Bart Simpson: Oh, please. (TO LISA) There's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't Santa.
Marge Simpson: A pony? Oh, Lisa. You've asked for that for the last three years and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. Can't you take a hint?
Lisa Simpson: But I really want a pony and I've been really, really good this year.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Oh, dear. Maybe Bart is a little more realistic.
Marge Simpson: (SHOCKED) A tattoo!
Homer Simpson: A what!
Bart Simpson: Yeah, they're cool and they last the rest of the your life.
Marge Simpson: (FIRM) You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.
Homer Simpson: Yeah. If you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.
Bart Simpson: All right!
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: (into phone) Y'ello.
Patty Bouvier: Marge, please.
Homer Simpson: (into phone) Who's this?
Patty Bouvier: May I please speak to Marge?
Homer Simpson: (into phone) This is her sister, isn't it?
Patty Bouvier: Is Marge there?
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Patty Bouvier: Hello, Marge. It's Patty. Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our baby sister for Christmas eve.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit, too.
Patty Bouvier: Somehow I doubt that Homer's excited. Of all the men you could have married, I don't know why you picked the one who's always so rude to us.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Bart Simpson: Good one, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Okay, kids. Prepare to be dazzled. (CALLING) Marge! Turn on the juice!

Marge Simpson: Thank God for Homer's Christmas bonus.

Bart Simpson: Ow! Quit it. It used to be a real boss tattoo.
Lisa Simpson: But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money having it surgically removed.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone.

Marge Simpson: I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (GRUNTS) Oh. I love you, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you tell me that all the time.
Homer Simpson: Oh, good. Because I do love you and I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that won't set off that horrible beeping.
Marge Simpson: But I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but...
Homer Simpson: Marge, well, let me be honest with you.

Homer Simpson: Oooh... pads of paper. I bet Bart can think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie. Oh, look, a little squeak-toy. (HE HOLDS UP A RUBBER PORK CHOP AND SQUEEZES). It says it's for dogs, but she can't read...
Ned Flanders: Ow. (FRIENDLY) Oh, Simpson, it's you.

(Santa's Workshop: int. santa's workshop)
Bart Simpson: Don't kill me, Dad. I didn't know it was you.

Homer Simpson: Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve.
Barney Gumble: Come on, Simpson. The dog's name is Whirlwind, ten to one shot. Money in the bank.
Homer Simpson: Uh-uh.
Bart Simpson: Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us.

Patty Bouvier: Oh, nothing dear. I'm just trashing your father.
Lisa Simpson: Well I wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. And I am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts.

Bart Simpson: An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on.
Bart Simpson: Oof!
Bart Simpson: At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off, but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop.
Conductor: Ticket, please.
Bart Simpson: (FRIGHTENED) I don't have a ticket.
Conductor: Come with me, boy.
Conductor: We've got a stowaway, sir.
Martin Prince: Twice the fare from Tucson to Flagstaff minus two thirds of the fare from Albuquerque to El Paso. (LAUGHS DEMONICALLY)
Bart Simpson: Yaaaaahhh!
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Bart, there are students in this class with a chance to do well. Will you stop bothering them?
Martin Prince: He's not bothering me, Mrs. Krabappel. I'm finished. May I go outside and read under a tree?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Certainly, Martin.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: What are you looking at, Bart? Are those naughty dogs back again?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: You have twenty minutes, class.
(Springfield Elementary School Playground: ext. school playground - LATER)
Marge Simpson: He's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard.
Homer Simpson: That's exactly the kind of crapola that's lousing him up. (NOTICES THE PICTURE OF THE PRINCIPAL) Hey, look at this! "I am a weiner." (CHUCKLES) He sure is!
(Skinner's Office: int. principal skinner's office)
Secretary: (OVER INTERCOM) Mr. and Mrs. Simpson are here.
Seymour Skinner: Send them in.
Marge Simpson: Hello again, Principal Skinner.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) What have you done this time, boy?
Seymour Skinner: I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?
Homer Simpson: Oh, no. He can't mean that.
Homer Simpson: My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.
Seymour Skinner: That was the idea.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Seymour Skinner: By itself something like this might not call for an extreme penalty...but this is not an isolated incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes...that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to...
Seymour Skinner: Well, at any rate, it is my reluctant decision --
Secretary: (THRU INTERCOM) Mr. Skinner, Doctor Pryor is here to see you. He says it's urgent.
Seymour Skinner: (INTO INTERCOM) Send him in.
Rod #2: (FROM SCREEN) We're radioactive!
Seymour Skinner: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, this our district psychiatrist, Dr. J. Loren Pryor.
Homer Simpson: What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh, on the contrary. I have some very exciting news for all of us. This aptitude test we administered this morning has revealed that young Bart here is what we call a "gifted child".
Homer Simpson: A what?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Your son is a genius, Mr. Simpson.
Marge Simpson: Bart?
Homer Simpson: This lunkhead?
Seymour Skinner: Impossible.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: No, no, we're quite certain. The child is not supposed to know his own I.Q., of course, but, uh, you can see it's beyond the range of any doubt.
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED) Nine hundred and twelve?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh, no, you have it upside down. It's two hundred and sixteen.
Homer Simpson: (CRESTFALLEN) Oh.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: That's still amazingly high.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Tell me, Bart, are you ever bored in school?
Bart Simpson: Oh, you bet.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Um-hmmm... Ever feel a little frustrated?
Bart Simpson: All the time, sir.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh-huh. Do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis?
Bart Simpson: Wow, it's like you're readin' my mind, man.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: (TO PARENTS) A-ha... You see, when a child with Bart's intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person, he's probably going to lash out in ways (PICKS UP BART'S FILES) like these.
Seymour Skinner: (ASIDE TO DR. PRYOR) I think we should re-test him.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: No, no, I think we should move him to another school.
Seymour Skinner: Oh. Better yet.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Bart, we'd like you to try a kind of school that doesn't rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers. (WAVES HIS HAND IN A DISMISSING FASHION) A school without walls. Where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to. Does that sound good, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Sign me up, Doc.
Homer Simpson: Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Excellent. We're all set, then. Here's all the information you need. (HANDS BART SOME LEAFLETS) Show up around nine-ish. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, congratulations once again.
Seymour Skinner: I think we're all in a mood to celebrate.
Homer Simpson: Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Well, genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment...
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh... although, in some cases it's a total mystery.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN)
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on, Mom.
Marge Simpson: You look very intelligent, dear.
Bart Simpson: No way.
Homer Simpson: How 'bout a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties.
Bart Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) You're stifling my creativity, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, boy.
Marge Simpson: Bart, this is a big day for you. Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?
Homer Simpson: Nonsense, Marge! Frosty Krusty Flakes are what got him where he is today.
Homer Simpson: It could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. Lisa, maybe you should try some of this.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up.
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART, QUIETLY) I don't care what that stupid test says, Bart. You're a dimwit.
Bart Simpson: (QUIETLY, TO LISA) Maybe so, but from now on, this dimwit is on Easy Street.
(Homer's Car: EXT. HOMER'S CAR - MORNING)
Bart Simpson: No rush, Dad. Take the scenic route.
Homer Simpson: Gotcha!
(NEW SCHOOL: EXT. NEW SCHOOL)
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY)
Bart Simpson: Oh, no. Ties.
Homer Simpson: Don't worry son, you can have mine. Here, let me show you how to put on a tie.
Homer Simpson: The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, Dad.
Bart Simpson: You kissed me.
Marge Simpson: Nurturing your brilliant brain, so I got tickets to the opera tonight. Hurry up, get dressed! It starts at eight.
Homer Simpson: Well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, I think. Now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we Simpsons have dreamed about for generations. You may outsmart someone.
Ms. Melon: You must be Bart Simpson. I'm Ms. Melon (PRONOUNCED ME-LAN), your learning coordinator.
Ms. Melon: Let me say right at the start that we have one rule here: Make your own rules. If you feel sleepy, take a nap. If you get bored, feel free to take out a book and start reading.
Bart Simpson: What should I read, ma'am?
Ms. Melon: Why, anything you want, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Ohhh!
Ms. Melon: A comic book. How did this get mixed in here? We used it last week as a prop in a film we made about illiteracy.
Ms. Melon: Bart, these are the students who will share your work area. This is Ethan Foley.
Ethan Foley: O Memsahib Bart, Rabbi has memo.
Bart Simpson: What?
Ms. Melon: (WRITES ON THE BLACKBOARD) Ethan is very good with palindromes -- you know, sentences spelled the same backwards and forwards. And this is Sidney Swift.
Sydney: "Trab, ing norm doog."
Bart Simpson: What's your problem?
Ms. Melon: Oh, don't mind Sidney. He's just speaking in backwards phonetics today. He said "Good morning, Bart". And this is Cecile Shapiro.
Cecile Shapiro: Hi, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Cool. Hamsters! (TAPS ON CAGE) What are their names?
Cecile Shapiro: (LOOKS PUZZLED) Hamster number one has been infected with a staphylococci virus. Hamster number two is the control hamster.
Bart Simpson: Hi, li'l control hamster.
Ms. Melon: I wouldn't get too attached, Bart. We're dissecting him next week.
Ms. Melon: Discover your desks, people.
Ms. Melon: Now, let's all welcome the newest member of our collective experience, Bart Simpson.
Ms. Melon: And now we can continue our debate from yesterday. When we left off, Calvin and Tanya were arguing that free will is an illusion.
Bart Simpson: Oh, Mom! Not tonight.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're going, too.
Ian: If you ask me, humankind has freedom, a freedom fraught with paradoxes. Freud shows how childhood shapes our subconscious mind, but this helps us to think for ourselves.
Ms. Melon: Very good, Ian. Does anyone else have an example of a paradox? (THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HANDS)
Ethan Foley: Without law and order, man has no freedom.
Cecile Shapiro: If you want peace, you must prepare for war.
Ms. Melon: Um-hmm, um-hmm... Well, it seems the smartest child in the class is also the quietest. Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives?
Bart Simpson: Well... you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.
Ms. Melon: Well, I guess that would be a paradox, too. (CHUCKLES) Thank you, Bart.
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Whew!
Calvin: Tell you what, Bart! I'll trade you the weight of a bowling ball on the eighth moon of Jupiter from my lunch for the weight of a feather on the second moon of Neptune from your lunch.
Bart Simpson: Well, okay.
Calvin: There you go.
Sydney: I will trade you one thousand picoliters of my milk for four gills of yours.
Bart Simpson: Well, all right.
Sydney: Anything you say.
Ian: Uh, Bart, would you wager your cupcake against my...
Bart Simpson: (SADLY) Save your breath.
Ethan Foley: What do you think of the new kid?
Ian: A rather mediocre genius.
Calvin: Yes, not very bright at all.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING)
Homer Simpson: So, how was it?
Bart Simpson: Os-os.
Homer Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: That's backwards for so-so.
Homer Simpson: Wow! What are you readin' there? (LOOKS) Comic books? Uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?
Homer Simpson: Tell you what: To celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
Bart Simpson: All righty!
Marge Simpson: Bart, I feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... What's that word where you encourage something to grow?
Homer Simpson: But I'm not a genius. Why should I suffer?
(Opera House: INT. OPERA HOUSE)
Bart Simpson: Hey, Lees, keep an eye out for the guy with the peanuts.

Bart Simpson: (SINGS LOW) "Toreador, oh, don't spit on the floor / Please use the cuspidor, that's what it's for."

Homer Simpson: Don't stifle the boy, Marge. We're supposed to encourage him.
Marge Simpson: Shush.
Marge Simpson: Shhh!
Homer Simpson: Who's the lard butt?
Lisa Simpson: He's the bullfighter.
Bart Simpson: No way a bull is gonna miss a target that big, man.
Martin Prince, Sr.: Who are those people?
Homer Simpson: P.U. When is this over?
Bart Simpson: It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
Homer Simpson: Is that one fat enough for you, son?
Homer Simpson: Let's go get a burger.
(CLASSROOM: INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING)
Ms. Melon: So Y equals R cubed over three, and if you determine the rate of change in this curve correctly, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
Ms. Melon: Well, don't you get it, Bart? Derivative D-Y equals three R squared D R over three, or R squared D R, or R D R R. Hardy-har-har! Get it?
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah. (A WEAK CHUCKLE)

Bart Simpson: Oh, no.
Homer Simpson: Well, I guess we don't have to do that.
Bart Simpson: Um, look Dad, I got something to tell you.
Homer Simpson: Can it wait, son? It's getting kinda dark.
Bart Simpson: All right, Homer, come on, baby. Right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind.

Homer Simpson: So what was it you wanted to tell me, son?
Bart Simpson: Uh, nothin', Pop.
(NEW CLASSROOM: int. new classroom - later that morning)
Ms. Melon: I'm still trying to get you a lab partner, Bart. If we don't get any volunteers soon, I'll assign somebody. Say, what's that? It looks dangerous.

Ms. Melon: All right, keep going. But you do know what happens when you mix acids and bases, right?
Bart Simpson: 'Course I do!
(SCHOOL BUILDING: ext. school building)
Bart Simpson: Sorry.
(OLD SCHOOL: int. old school - dr. pryor's office)
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Now, Bart, we want to emphasize that nobody's angry about this. We're... we're just concerned. When a young man with a two hundred sixteen I.Q. can't make a simple experiment work, well, it doesn't take a Bart Simpson to figure out that something's wrong. Tell me, is the class moving too slowly for you?
Bart Simpson: Lord, no.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Well then what can we do to make you happy?
Bart Simpson: I want to go back to my old class.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh, but, Bart, don't you remember the boredom... the ennui... the intellectual malaise?
Bart Simpson: Yeah, well, you know... kinda... but I was thinking I could go undercover.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Undercover? Bart, I'm intrigued. Go on.
Bart Simpson: Well, I could pretend I'm a regular dumb kid. You know... to study them, and all the stuff they do with each other. You know, see what makes them tick.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I see... like Jane Goodall and the chimps.
Bart Simpson: Yeah.
Rod #1: (FROM SCREEN) Of course we're hot.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh-huh, this is most impressive, Bart. You write up your proposal while I talk to Principal Skinner.
Bart Simpson: Proposal?
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: You know, outline your project, what you hope to achieve, what you'll require to do it.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha, man.
Bart Simpson: "My Proposal" by Bart Simpson. I want to pretend I am a regular dumb kid... period. By this I hope... oh no... for this I will... um... require... (SIGHS; ALOUD) Aw, man!
Bart Simpson: (SIGHS) "My Confession" by Bart Simpson. I am a regular dumb kid... period. I cheated on my intelligence test... period.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Uh, finished already? (CHUCKLES) Principal Skinner will be very interested to... to...

Bart Simpson: Dad... I gotta tell you something... Hope you won't be too mad...
Homer Simpson: (CONCERNED) What is it, son?
Bart Simpson: I'm not a genius, Dad.
Homer Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: I cheated on the intelligence test. I'm sorry. But I just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together, you've helped me out with things, and we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, Dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad.

Homer Simpson: "Dear Family: I am an utter failure and you'll be better off without me. By the time you read this, I will be in my watery grave. I can only leave you with the words my father gave me: 'Stand tall, have courage and never give up.' I only hope I can provide a better model in death than I did in life. Warmest regards, (HE SCRATCHES IT OUT) Love Homer J. Simpson."

Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer, how could you think of killing yourself? We love you.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, Dad. / Yeah. / We love you.
Homer Simpson: Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign.

Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah!
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah?
Homer Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT) Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed Councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. Danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --

Homer Simpson: I think we should put a stop sign at D Street and Twelfth. The other --
Councilman #1: All in favor?
COUNCILMEN #1/#2: (TOGETHER) Aye.
Councilman #1: Approved. Meeting adjourned. Coffee and maple logs in the lobby.
Homer Simpson: Wow. They listened to me.
Lisa Simpson: All right, Dad!
Bart Simpson: Way to go, Homer!
Marge Simpson: You did it, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Hey, if they think I'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken.
(Park: ext. park - day)
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer. I am so proud of you.
Homer Simpson: (DOWN) Proud. Proud of what?
Marge Simpson: Well, everything. (GESTURING) Your dip sign, for instance. Now people won't be caught off-guard by that little (MAKES DIP GESTURE WITH HER HAND) in the road.
Homer Simpson: Ah, what a great family! But come on, we all know this is small potatoes. There is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together.
Lisa Simpson: What, Dad?
Homer Simpson: I'm talking about that!
Marge Simpson: You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?
Lisa Simpson: Wow!
Bart Simpson: (MUMBLING) Gee, Dad's a hero.
Homer Simpson: What did you say, son?
Bart Simpson: Nothin'.
Homer Simpson: That's okay. I'll just assume you said what I thought I heard you say.

Demonstrator #1: (INTO BULLHORN) The fifteen miles per hour speed limit on Main Street.
Demonstrator #1: (INTO BULLHORN) I give you the man whose very name is synonymous with safety... Homer Simpson!
Crowd: (CHANTING) Homer! Homer!
Homer Simpson: (INTO bullhorn) Thank you.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah!
Homer Simpson: (INTO bullhorn) Unlike most of you, I am not a nut. Just a good, honest American who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur.
(Burns's Office: INT. Montgomery Burns' Office)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SIGHS) Look at that man. He has the crowd in the palm of his hand. Haven't seen anything like it since Jolson. Who is he?
Waylon Smithers: (Hands Burns binoculars) That's Homer Simpson, sir. He used to work here in the plant, but we fired him for gross incompetence.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, so that's his little game. Get this Simpson character up here right now.
Waylon Smithers: But, Mr. Burns --
C. Montgomery Burns: I said, DO IT! NOW, DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: EXT. Power Plant)
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks!
Bart Simpson: Right on, Dad!
Waylon Smithers: Hey, hey, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Burns wants to talk to you, privately.
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Privately?
Waylon Smithers: (Pushing away bullhorn) Yes.
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN; TO CROWD) Stay here, I'll be right back.
(Burns's Office: INT. Montgomery Burns' Office)
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, Homer Simpson, at last we meet.
Homer Simpson: Same here.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson. I want you to rejoin our power plant family.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, no can do!
C. Montgomery Burns: Hear me out, Simpson. I don't want you to come back as a Technical Supervisor, or Supervising Technician, or whatever the hell you used to do. I want you to be in charge of safety here at the plant.
Homer Simpson: Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about.
C. Montgomery Burns: The generous offer I'm making is good for exactly thirty seconds, Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah!
Homer Simpson: Hey! What's the problem here?
Homer Simpson: (THINKS) Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. (THEN) Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. (THEN) Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. (THEN) I can't let Marge support the family. (THEN) This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I...
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson! Time's up!
Homer Simpson: Umm... What the hey. I'll take the job.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent! Your first duty will be to step out on the (GESTURING) balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.
Homer Simpson: (GASP) What?
C. Montgomery Burns: Go on, Homer.
Lisa Simpson: Go, Dad!
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN) Oh, sit tight. I'll be right back.
Homer Simpson: I can't do it, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: You mean you're willing to give up a good job and a raise just for your principles?
Homer Simpson: Hmm. When you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. But that's the lug you're looking at. And I vow to continue spending every free minute I have crusading for safety. Of course, I'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job.
C. Montgomery Burns: You're not as stupid as you look... or sound... or our best testing indicates.
C. Montgomery Burns: You've got the job. Now get to work.
Homer Simpson: I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
(PLANT: ext. plant)
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN; SNIFFLING) Friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. You have to learn that there's a little Homer Simpson in all of us.
Homer Simpson: (INTO BULLHORN; COVERING) ...and I'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. The only reason I'm telling you this is I'm going to be leaving you.
Homer Simpson: But, don't worry. I've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!
Bart Simpson: Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad watch out!
Homer Simpson: Whoa! Easy! Don't drop me! Be careful.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - morning)
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah?

Bart Simpson: You love him more!
Lisa Simpson: No, you do!
Bart Simpson: No, I don't!
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you do!
Bart Simpson: No I don't!

(KITCHEN: int. kitchen - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Mmmm! Marshmallow!
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: I'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while I can, Marge. I don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic.
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR OF ASSENT)
Homer Simpson: (INDICATING GELATIN) Are you sure that's enough? You know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.
Marge Simpson: (FLATTERED) Oh, Homer, Mr. Burns just said he liked it. Once.
Homer Simpson: Marge, that's the only time he's ever spoken to me without using the word "bonehead".

C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, please, please, don't fight. Just go out back and have a good time.
C. Montgomery Burns: Fire that man, Smithers. I don't want him or his unpleasant family to ruin my picnic.

Bart Simpson: Bart.
Homer Simpson: Don't correct the man, Brat. (TO BURNS) Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, for the love of Peter! That's all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there.
C. Montgomery Burns: And make yourselves at home.
Bart Simpson: Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.
Homer Simpson: Why you, listen to me you...
C. Montgomery Burns: Trouble, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: No, heh, heh, heh. Just congratulating the son on a fine joke about his old man.

Marge Simpson: Oh, what an adorable little girl.
Mrs. Long: Thank you. (GAZING AT MAGGIE) Why don't we dump them in the nursery, and get a glass of punch?
Marge Simpson: Oh, I'm not much of a drinker.
Mrs. Long: (POINTING O.S.) Hey, isn't that your boy there, torturing the swans?
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) Ummm... Maybe I will take you up on that punch.

Homer Simpson: (GRUMBLES) You remember the rules from last year?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Shut my mouth and let your boss win.
Bart Simpson: Hey!
Wife #1: I don't know who to love more. My son Joshua, who is captain of the football team, or my daughter Amber, who got the lead in the school play. Usually I use their grades as a tie-breaker, but they both got straight A's this term, so what's a mother to do?
Marge Simpson: Uh-huh. Well, uh... I sense greatness in my family.
Wife #2: Your family?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. (FINISHES DRINK; TIPSILY) I don't want to alarm anyone, but I think there's a li'l al-key-hol in this punch.

Homer Simpson: (SOTTO) Quick, Bart, give me a kiss.
Bart Simpson: Kiss you? But, Dad, I'm your kid!

Marge Simpson: Ohh!
Lisa Simpson: Hey!
Homer Simpson: Look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. We've got to do better as a family. So tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the TV. We're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family.
(Simpson Dining Room: int. simpson dining room - a little later)

Homer Simpson: No. We're going to say grace first.
Bart Simpson: Okay. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub.
Homer Simpson: No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the chatter and bow your heads. (CLEARS THROAT) Dear Lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it. I mean, our kids are uncontrollable hellions... pardon my French... but they act like savages! Did you see them at the picnic? Oh, of course you did. You're everywhere. You're omnivorous. Oh, Lord, why did you smite me with this family?
Lisa Simpson: Amen. Let's eat.
Homer Simpson: No! I'm not done yet.
Marge Simpson: But Homer, how long are we supposed to sit here and listen to you badmouth us to the Man upstairs?
Homer Simpson: I'm sorry, Marge, but sometimes I think we're the worst family in town.
Marge Simpson: Maybe we should move to a larger community.
Bart Simpson: Don't have a cow, Dad.
Lisa Simpson: The sad truth is all families are like us.

Selma Bouvier: (LOW) No.
Homer Simpson: You know, Moe, my Mom once said something that really stuck with me. She said, "Homer, you're a big disappointment," and, God bless her soul, she was really onto something.
Barney Gumble: Don't blame yourself, Homer. You got dealt a bad hand. You got crummy little kids that nobody can control.

Marge Simpson: Gee, Homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?
Homer Simpson: Honey, I've given this matter a lot of study. And of all the commercials I saw, his was the best. (BEAT) All it costs is two hundred and fifty dollars.
Marge Simpson: But we don't have that kind of money.
Homer Simpson: Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund.
Lisa Simpson: Hey!
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?
Marge Simpson: ...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. Eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents.
Homer Simpson: That's it? That's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?
Lisa Simpson: I guess I'd have needed a partial scholarship.
Homer Simpson: Well, we're not licked yet. To save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice.
Lisa Simpson: No, Dad! Please don't pawn the TV!
Bart Simpson: Oh, c'mon Dad! Anything but that!

Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, no, Homer, don't stifle the youngster. Your family must feel free to express itself. That's what these pads and jumbo markers are for. I want you to draw for me your fears, your anxieties, the roots of your unhappiness. Now take a deep, cleansing breath...and begin.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No surprises here. Homer?
Homer Simpson: (HUMS)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Homer, what have you got for us? (BEAT) Homer?
Homer Simpson: Whoops. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Well, if you had been paying attention, perhaps you would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority figure - an ogre, if you will.
Marge Simpson: Now, Doctor, that's not true.
Lisa Simpson: "Ogre" is such a strong word.
Bart Simpson: Right on, Doc. Another successful diagnosis.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Whoa! (CHUCKLE) Okay, you want to kill each other. That's good. That's healthy. There's nothing necessarily wrong with hostile conflict. All I ask is that you use my patented aggression therapy mallets.
Homer Simpson: Good idea.
Bart Simpson: All right!
Marge Simpson: (TROUBLED) I don't know...
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Okay, let's take another deep, cleansing breath.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. What's the point?
Bart Simpson: They'd work much better without the padding, Doc.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, no. That's not true.
Bart Simpson: See.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Ow! Gimme that.
(Bathroom: int. bathroom)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (MAD) Yes, well, that concludes this portion of our treatment.
Marge Simpson: Are we cured yet?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Don't be ridiculous. You will be cured, but it's going to require somewhat more unorthodox methods.
Homer Simpson: Unortho what?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Don't worry, I'll have plenty of time to explain while I warm up the electric generator.

Dr. Marvin Monroe: Everyone comfy? Good. Now, don't touch any of those buttons in front of you, for a very important reason, i.e. you are wired in to the rest of your family. You have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--
Homer Simpson: Arrrgh!
Bart Simpson: Just testing.
Homer Simpson: Why you...
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, Homer! Not yet!
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED NOISE)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: You see, this is what is known as aversion therapy. When someone hurts you emotionally, you will hurt them physically, and gradually you will learn not to hurt each other at all. And won't that be wonderful, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (SEEMINGLY MOVED) Oh, yes, doctor.
Bart Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!
Marge Simpson: Bart, how could you shock your little sister?
Bart Simpson: My finger slipped.
Bart Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: So did mine.
Marge Simpson: Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!
Homer Simpson: Arrrgh!
Lisa Simpson: Arrrgh!

Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, I'm sorry, you're not. Please, you've just got to go.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Oh but that was just... All right. (TO RECEPTIONIST) Get the money.
(Waiting Room: int. waiting room - a little later)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (HANDING THE MONEY TO HOMER) (INDECIPHERABLE COUNTING) five hundred. Here! Just go, and never tell anyone you were here.
Homer Simpson: Wow! Five hundred smackers!
Marge Simpson: Homer, how wonderful. Our first pleasant surprise.
Lisa Simpson: It's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.
Bart Simpson: You did it, Dad.
Marge Simpson: Excuse me, dear. Shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our TV back?
Homer Simpson: That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
Bart Simpson: Yay!

Lisa Simpson: It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday!
Bart Simpson: You know, there are names for people like you.
Lisa Simpson: No there aren't.
Bart Simpson: Teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser...
Homer Simpson: Bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing.
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Homer Simpson: Well, you see, boy. It never hurts to grease the wheels a little.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad. I like my teacher.
Homer Simpson: Surely, Lisa. (To BART) You see how it works, Bart? (GESTURING WITH CUPCAKE) A cupcake here, a good grade there.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I get good grades 'cause I'm smart and I pay attention and I study hard.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, right, Lis. (TO BART) It's the three roads to success, Bart. Work, brains, and... (GESTURES WITH CUPCAKE)

Otto Mann: That's bad news, man.
Lisa Simpson: Here, Otto, I made an extra one for you.
Otto Mann: Oh, thanks, little lady.
Lisa Simpson: (PLEASED) You're welcome.
Bart Simpson: Better let me hold these, Lis.
Lisa Simpson: (SNAPPING) Forget it.
Bart Simpson: (CONTEMPTUOUSLY) You sniveling toad! You little egg sucker!
Lisa Simpson: Tell me more.
Bart Simpson: (EXASPERATED GRUNT) Backscratcher! Foot licker! Honor student!
Lisa Simpson: (SMUGLY) You'll never get one now, Mr. Name-caller.
Bart Simpson: (THE VOICE OF REASON) All right, all right. Look. I'm sorry. I-I got upset. In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didn't mean.
Lisa Simpson: You weren't thinking, were you?
Bart Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not a sniveling toad, am I?
Bart Simpson: Not really.
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: I'm not a little egg sucker, am I?
Bart Simpson: Of course not.
Lisa Simpson: Then what am I?

Bart Simpson: So give her back those cupcakes before I knock your block off.
Lisa Simpson: Don't Bart! He's a friend of Nelson Muntz.
Weasel #1: Nelson, you're bleeding.
Nelson Muntz: Nah. This happens all the time. Somebody else's blood splatters on me.
Nelson Muntz: Hey, wait a minute. You're right. (TO BART) You made me bleed my own blood.
Bart Simpson: (SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED) Uh, it was an ACCIDENT, man. A terrible ghastly mistake! Ask anybody!

Maggie Simpson: (SUCKS)
Lisa Simpson: Bart, here's that cupcake you wanted. I can't help but think if I had just given it to you in the first place, this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided. I know you can't eat it now, so I'll just place it lovingly on your forehead. (LISA PLACES CUPCAKE ON BART'S HEAD).

Homer Simpson: So, what's the problem, son?
Bart Simpson: (INTIMATE) I had a run-in with a bully.
Marge Simpson: A bully?!
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge. I don't bug you when you're helping Lisa.
Marge Simpson: Well, Bart, I hope you're going straight to the principal about this.
Bart Simpson: I guess I could do that.
Homer Simpson: What? And violate the code of the school yard? I'd rather Bart died.
Marge Simpson: What on earth are you talking about, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (AMAZED AT HER IGNORANCE) The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Let's see... Don't tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?
Bart Simpson: I know. (COUGHS UP BASEBALL CAP)
Marge Simpson: Oh Homer, that's ridiculous. (GROANS) Bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?
Bart Simpson: What do you mean, Mom?
Homer Simpson: (MYSTIFIED) Yeah, right! This ought to be good for a laugh.
Marge Simpson: Shh! This bully friend of yours... Is he a little on the chunky side?
Bart Simpson: Yeah, - he's pretty chunkified, all right.
Marge Simpson: Huh huh. And I'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.
Bart Simpson: No. He's pretty dumb. He's in all the same special classes I am.
Marge Simpson: That's why he lashes out at the world.
Homer Simpson: Aw, Marge.
Marge Simpson: So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go.
Homer Simpson: Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Maharishi Gandhi. Let's go, boy.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.
Homer Simpson: No, no! Not like that! Like this!
Homer Simpson: See, that boy? You didn't expect that, did you? And neither will he.
Bart Simpson: (DISBELIEVING) You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?
Homer Simpson: Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.
Bart Simpson: Amen.
Homer Simpson: So the next time this bully thinks you're gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when he's staggering around, blinded...
Bart Simpson: (STARTING TO UNDERSTAND) Yeah!
Homer Simpson: And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha.
Homer Simpson: And if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. That little doozy's been a Simpson trademark for generations.

Bart Simpson: None.
Herman Hermann: You'll need more. And you'll need to train them, hard. Now let's see...
Herman Hermann: Okay... The key to Springfield has always been Elm Street: The Greeks knew it. The Carthaginians knew it. Now you know it. First, you'll need a declaration of war.
Herman Hermann: That way everything you do will be nice and legal. (LOOKING OVER DOCUMENT) Okay, I can use this one from the Franco­ Prusssian War. I'll just change Otto von Bismark to read Bart Simpson and...

Herman Hermann: (SCOWLING) Well, I'd rather they say "Death From Above," but I guess we're stuck.
Herman Hermann: Okay, our main force will be split into two groups. One will circle around this way to cut off the enemy's retreat. The other will drive in this way closing the trap. It's a classic pincers movement. It can't fail against a ten-year-old.

Ms. Barr: Lisa, we are playing dodge ball here. The object of the game is to avoid the ball by weaving or ducking out of its path.
Lisa Simpson: In other words, to dodge the ball.
Ms. Barr: Listen, missy, just tell me why you weren't getting out of the way of those balls.
Lisa Simpson: I'm too sad.
Ms. Barr: Too sad to play dodge ball? That's ridiculous. Now, let's see some enthusiasm! Play ball!
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - afternoon)
Homer Simpson: Come on, come on. Let's go.
Bart Simpson: In the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson. (WHISTLES) Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout...
Homer Simpson: (QUIET DIGNITY) Must you do this every time?
Bart Simpson: ...Homer "The Human Punching Bag" Simpson. Boo! Boo! Hiss!
Bart Simpson: And Homer is down! (LAUGH) Three seconds, folks -- a new record!
Homer Simpson: Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!
Homer Simpson: Okay. Here we go.
Bart Simpson: Yo, chump, you back again?
Homer Simpson: (GRUNTS) Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Ohhh... get out of the corner!
Marge Simpson: But they sent a note from school.
Homer Simpson: (CONCENTRATING) What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way.
Bart Simpson: I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. There's no way they can prove anything.
Marge Simpson: No, Bart. This note isn't about you.
Bart Simpson: It isn't? There must be some mistake.
Bart Simpson: Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Lisa?
Homer Simpson: (READING) "Lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad." Well, she doesn't look sad. (PEERING CLOSELY AT LISA) I don't see any tears in her eyes.
Lisa Simpson: It's not that kind of sad. I'm sorry, Dad, but you wouldn't understand.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure I would, princess. I have feelings, too. You know, like "my stomach hurts" or "I'm going crazy". Why don't you climb up on Daddy's knee and tell him all about it?
Lisa Simpson: I'm just wondering, what's the point? Would it make any difference at all if I never existed? How can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?
Homer Simpson: Well... eh... er...eh...
Homer Simpson: Come on, Lisa... ride the Homer horsey. Giddiyap! Whee! (chuckles)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and I'll draw you a nice hot bath? That helps me when I feel sad.
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Dad. I know you mean well.
Homer Simpson: (TO LISA) Thanks for knowing I mean well.
Bart Simpson: Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands.
Homer Simpson: You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, I didn't do anything wrong.
Homer Simpson: In times of trouble, you got to go with what you know. Now hop to it, boy!
(LIVING ROOM: int. living room - a little later)
Bart Simpson: (GRUMBLES) Stupid Homer... (MUMBLES) Thinks he's so big... Stupid Homer...(MORE MUMBLING) Stupid Homer. I'll show him.
Bart Simpson: (MAD) Enjoy your bath?
Lisa Simpson: No. Not really.
Bart Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: (TO MAGGIE) So typical of Bart. All he thinks about is himself.
Bart Simpson: Hey, don't say stuff like that about me to Maggie. She's on my side, anyway.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too.
Lisa Simpson: Is not.
Bart Simpson: Is, too. Watch, I'll prove it. Maggie, come to the one you love best.
Lisa Simpson: (DRAGGED INTO IT) No, Maggie! (BECKONING) Come here, girl. Come to me.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Maggie. The choice is obvious.
Lisa Simpson: No, Maggie, don't go for the glitter. Look for substance.
Lisa Simpson: All right Maggie, just go to Bart.
Bart Simpson: Exactly, come to the one you love.
Homer Simpson: Oh, no, come on! Don't let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Don't. Don't. Don't. Great, get over. Oh, geeze.
Bart Simpson: Gee, Dad, you're really bad at this.
Homer Simpson: I am not. It's just that (LISA'S SAX IS HEARD) I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. (CALLING) Lisa! Lisa!
(Lisa's Bedroom: int. lisa's bedroom - night - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) Lisa, what did I tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?
Lisa Simpson: (SADLY) I was just playing the blues... (PAUSE) ...Dad.
Homer Simpson: Lisa, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy.
Lisa Simpson: No, that's okay, Dad. (SNIFFS) I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you.
Homer Simpson: (SINCERE) Let's hear it.
Homer Simpson: You just clack as loud as you want. Lis.
Lisa Simpson: I've got to find that sound.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson's house - continuous)
(Street: EXT. STREET - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT)
(Bridge: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT)
Lisa Simpson: That was beautiful. What's it called?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: It's a little tune that I call the "I Never Had An Italian Suit Blues."
(Simpson Master Bedroom: int. homer and marge's bedroom - night)
Jacqueline Bouvier: Wait, Margie. Before you go out that door, let's put our happy face on. Because people know how good a mommy you have by the size of your smile.
Homer Simpson: What th...
Bart Simpson: Put up your dukes, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Homer Simpson: Bart, go easy on me. I'm your Dad.
Bart Simpson: I am going easy on you, but you're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic.
Homer Simpson: No, Bart, no.
Marge Simpson: Homer, wake up! Wake up! Oh my, here let me wipe off that drool.
Homer Simpson: You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know, Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention, but all the while our little Lisa's becoming a young woman.
Homer Simpson: Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR) Good night, Homer.
(Bridge: ext. bridge - night)
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (AS SHE PLAYS) Now -- low B-flat.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Okay, Lisa -- altissimo register.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Very nice, very nice. I once ruptured myself doing that.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, Mr. Murphy.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: My friends call me Bleeding Gums.
Lisa Simpson: Ew! How'd you get a name like that?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Well, let me put it this way. You ever been to the dentist?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Not me. I suppose I should go to one, but I got enough pain in my life as it is.
Lisa Simpson: I have problems, too.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: Well, I can't help you, kid. I'm just a terrific horn player with tons of soul. But I can jam with you.
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) OH I'M SO LONELY, SINCE MY BABY LEFT ME / I GOT NO MONEY, AND NOTHING IS FREE / OH I BEEN SO LONELY, SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN / ALL I GOT IS THIS RUSTY... THIS RUSTY OLD HORN.
Lisa Simpson: (SINGS) "I got a bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / I'm the sa...dest kid in grade number two."
Bart Simpson: Aw come on, I'll cheer you up.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: You know, you play pretty well for someone with no real problems.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, but I don't feel any better.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: The blues isn't about feeling better. It's about making other people feel worse and making a few bucks while you're at it. Which reminds me, if you're ever in the neighborhood, I'm playing at a little club called the Jazz Hole...
Marge Simpson: Lisa, get away from that jazzman!
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, can't I... stay a little longer?
Marge Simpson: Come on, come on. We were worried about you. (TO MURPHY) Nothing personal. I just fear the unfamiliar.
(Simpson Living Room: int. simpson living room - the next day)

Homer Simpson: Marge, are you all right?
Marge Simpson: No, I'm very upset.
Homer Simpson: Then you've heard. Oh, God. What are we doing to do? The lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!
Marge Simpson: I'm upset about Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Me, too.
Bart Simpson: Me three. What are we talking about?
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: Do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, Bart?
Bart Simpson: Oh, yeah. Easy.
Marge Simpson: You do love her, don't you?
Bart Simpson: (MUTTERS) Oh, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Well you do, don't you?
Bart Simpson: Don't make me say it. I know the answer, you know the answer, he knows the answer, let's just drop it. Okay?
Marge Simpson: Okay, Bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. Be nice to your sister.
Bart Simpson: Okey-dokey.
Marge Simpson: Go on, Bart. No time like the present.
(FOYER: int. foyer)
Bart Simpson: Hi, man.
Lisa Simpson: I don't want your pity.
Lisa Simpson: How?
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Yeah! Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.

Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Who?
Bart Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Jacques. Last name Strap.
Moe Szyslak: Hold on. (CALLS OUT) Uh..Jacques Strap! Hey, guys, I'm looking for a Jacques Strap!
Barflies: (CHUCKLE)
Moe Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) What -- oh! Wait a minute -- Jacques Strap? It's you, isn't it? You cowardly little runt. When I get hold of you I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house)
Bart Simpson: Where's your sense of humor, man?
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS)
Marge Simpson: Lisa, you'll be late for band practice. Let's go.
(Noiseland Arcade: ext. video arcade - day)
Homer Simpson: Gimme some quarters. (COVERING) I'm doing my laundry.
Cashier: (OVER MICROPHONE; SARCASTIC) Yeah, right.
Homer Simpson: (LOW) Where's the video boxing?
Cashier: (OVER MICROPHONE) It's over there in the corner, but if I were you, I really would use those quarters for laundry.
Homer Simpson: (RE: CHAMP) Hey, that kid's pretty good.
Boy Onlooker: Good? Are you kidding? Over two thousand fights, and he's still on his original quarter.
Champ: Okay? Who's next?
Kids: (WAVING QUARTERS) Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
Homer Simpson: (TOWERING OVER CROWD WITH HIS BAG OF QUARTERS) No, me! No, Me!
Homer Simpson: Listen -- can you teach me to fight like you do?
Champ: I don't think so.
Homer Simpson: Aw, come on.
Champ: I'll tell you what, I'll do it if you bark like a dog.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Champ: (LAUGHING) You got yourself a deal, Fido.
(Noiseland Arcade: int. arcade - sometime later)
Champ: Well, looks like you're all out of quarters, old man.
Homer Simpson: That's okay. With the tips you've given me, I'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight. (CHUCKLES)
Woman: (TO CHAMP) Howie! I thought I told you to stop wasting your money in this stupid place.
Champ: Uh-oh. Sorry, Mom.
Woman: And you! A man of your age! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Homer Simpson: Excuse me. I think I hear my wife calling.
(Marge's Car: int. marge's car - day)
Lisa Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT)
Marge Simpson: Now, Lisa, listen to me. This is important. I want you to smile today.
Lisa Simpson: But I don't feel like smiling.
Marge Simpson: Well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. It's what shows up on the surface that counts. That's what my mother taught me. Take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. And then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow.
Marge Simpson: Come on. You can do better than that.
Marge Simpson: Ah, that's my girl.
Lisa Simpson: I feel more popular already.
(Springfield Elementary School Yard: ext. school yard - continuous)
Ralph Wiggum: Hey, nice smile.
Lisa Simpson: (BRAVELY) Thanks.
Stan: Hey! What are you talking to her for? She's just going to say something weird.
Lisa Simpson: (THROUGH CLENCHED SMILING TEETH) Not me.
Ralph Wiggum: You know, I used to think you were some sort of a brainiac, but... I guess you're okay.
Lisa Simpson: (THROUGH SMILE) Uh-huh.
Stan: Hey, why don't come over to my house after practice? You can do my homework.
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
Marge Simpson: (Murmurs OF annoyance)
Dewey Largo: Five minutes, people. Five minutes. Now, Miss Simpson, I hope we won't have a repeat of yesterday's outburst of unbridled... creativity.
Marge Simpson: (Murmur OF extreme annoyance)
Lisa Simpson: No, sir.
Lisa Simpson: Wow, Mom.
Dewey Largo: So that's where she gets it.
Marge Simpson: (TRULY DISTRAUGHT) Lisa, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I take it all back. Always be yourself. You want to be sad, honey, be sad. We'll ride it out with you. And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us.
Lisa Simpson: Okay, Mom.
Marge Simpson: I said you could stop smiling, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: I feel like smiling.
Bart Simpson: (BORED) I'm going to knock you out one more time and that's it. This is getting boring, man.
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh.
Bart Simpson: Whoa!
Homer Simpson: Kid, tonight's not your night.
Bart Simpson: All right, man. You asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.
Homer Simpson: Oh! Oh! Block it.
Bart Simpson: Wha' the...
Homer Simpson: (GRUNT; CHUCKLE) Uh-oh. You missed me.
Homer Simpson: Ha ha! I got you. Don't try that. I got ya. I'll block you. (IMITATING RING ANNOUNCER) And the crowd is on its feet as Hurricane Homer moves in for the kill.
Marge Simpson: Boys, I'd like your attention, please.
Homer Simpson: Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment.
Homer Simpson: Bart-the-bloody-pulp Simpson is on the ropes. He's hoping I'll put him out of his misery. Well, you're in luck, Bart, here comes my right.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Oh, noooo!
Homer Simpson: My game! My game! I coulda beat the boy! Marge, how could you? I was so close.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game.
Bart Simpson: You're right, Mom. I'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing.
Homer Simpson: (EXASPERATED GRUNT)
Marge Simpson: Oh, calm down, Homer. Lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family.
(JAZZ HOLE NIGHTCLUB: int. jazz hole nightclub)
Bleeding Gums Murphy: This next song was written by a friend of mine, one of the great little ladies of jazz.
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) "I got this bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin' my own mother, gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo."
Homer Simpson: What?
Bleeding Gums Murphy: (SINGS) "I'm the saddest kid in grade number two."
(Simpson Front Yard: EXT. SIMPSON'S FRONT YARD - SATURDAY MORNING)
Bart Simpson: (GRUNTS WITH EXERTION) Rusty old hunk of junk.
Rod Flanders: (VERY FRIENDLY) Howdy, Bart. Hot enough for ya?
Bart Simpson: (GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF) Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we can't get a decent mower like the Flanders?
Bart Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: Just be happy with what you got, son. Don't try to keep up with the Flanderses.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS)
Ned Flanders: How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?
Bart Simpson: (UNRESERVEDLY) Wow, man! What an RV!
Homer Simpson: Bart! (TO FLANDERS) I suppose it has..uh..various features?
NED: It's got everything! Microwave, dishwasher, big-screen TV, deep fryer, and... see up there on the roof?
Homer Simpson: (CROAKING) A satellite dish!
Ned Flanders: Yes indeedilly-doodily.
Homer Simpson: But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do.
Ned Flanders: Simple, Simpson. Credit.
Homer Simpson: Oooh! Credit.
(Bob's RV Round-Up (Formerly RVs Я Us): ext. bob's rv roundup (FORMERLY RVS Я US) - A LITTLE LATER)
Cowboy Bob: Thank you God. Heh, heh. (CLEARS THROAT) May I help you?
Marge Simpson: (QUICKLY) We're just browsing, thank you.
Homer Simpson: I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?
Cowboy Bob: Yes, I do. That would be... the Ultimate Behemoth.
Homer Simpson: (EXCITED) Where is it?
Marge Simpson: Homer.
Cowboy Bob: We're standing in its presence. Behold! Isn't she... Look at this thing...
Cowboy Bob: Can you believe it? Man built this. It's a vehicle.
Homer Simpson: (BABBLES SPEECHLESSLY)
Bart Simpson: Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?
Cowboy Bob: You can tell your son, it has its own satellite. The VanStar One launched last February, just for this thing. That's all.
Bart Simpson: Oh man!
Marge Simpson: I'm not sure that we can afford...
Homer Simpson: (EAGERLY) Does it have a deep fryer?
Cowboy Bob: It has four of them. One for each part of the chicken.
Marge Simpson: I don't think we can afford this, Homer.
Salesman: Let's worry about that later. C'mon let's take a tour. Want to? C'mon.
(INSIDE THE ULTIMATE BEHEMOTH: int. inside the ultimate behemoth - continues)
Bart Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Aye carumba!
Lisa Simpson: This is better than our house!
Homer Simpson: Wait till Flanders gets a load of this.
Marge Simpson: (WORRIED) It all seems so expensive...
Homer Simpson: Hey, how much is it?
Cowboy Bob: You're a man of convict... You just wanted to ask that and blurted it out. Didn't you?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, how much is it?
Cowboy Bob: Well, first of all, I want you to know, I like your face.
Homer Simpson: You do?
Cowboy Bob: Really. I really do. I'm not just saying that. I mean it. You've got color in there. You're not Roman are you?
Homer Simpson: No.
Cowboy Bob: You look like a God, sort of. Why don't we step into the credit office, Zeus? (CHUCKLING) Hey your dad's just gonna come in here and work it out. Then you'll drive home in this.
(INSIDE CREDIT OFFICE: int. inside credit office - a few minutes later)
Cowboy Bob: I'm not gonna quote you a price until I check your credit rating. Lemme. I want to make myself clear on this. This is a formality. If you're saying to me, Bob, is this guy good for it? I say, yes. I don't check this machine. But I don't own the place. Even though my name's up there. Long story. But that doesn't matter. I'm gonna have to run it through the computer.
Homer Simpson: Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
Cowboy Bob: You ever known a siren to be good? Ha! No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind telling me, sell a vehicle to this fellow and you're out of business. That's what the siren says.
Homer Simpson: Oh.
Cowboy Bob: It seems the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. And wee bit is me being polite. You couldn't afford this thing if you lived to be a million.
Homer Simpson: Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? (SADLY) I don't want to go away empty-handed, Bob.
Cowboy Bob: Take it easy there. Don't ruin this feeling I'm getting from you. Perhaps I can show you something a little more... you.

Cowboy Bob: Well, what do you think?
Marge Simpson: Used, isn't it?
Cowboy Bob: Mr. Simpson, you're never gonna own a better RV. And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean literally, buddy, this is it for you. You know, it's this or a wagon.
Homer Simpson: How much do you want for it?
Cowboy Bob: This is for you? This is yours? The price I'm quoting you? You're not gonna hand it to someone else? 'Cause I'm gonna give you a price for you, not for someone else... someone else, I'm doubling this.
Homer Simpson: I swear it Bob.
Cowboy Bob: This is you and me?
Homer Simpson: Yeah!
Cowboy Bob: In other words, two months from now I see this vehicle, your head's in that window?
Homer Simpson: On my honor.
Cowboy Bob: Three-fifty a month.
Homer Simpson: Oh, well, I don't know. Would it be alright if I conferred with my family?
Cowboy Bob: Mr. Simpson, if you have to go talk it over with those humans out there, then, there's something wrong with all of us. You look like a man who is able to make a decision or I wouldn't be wasting my... See that man right over there?
Homer Simpson: Yeah!
Cowboy Bob: He's buying this. Did you know that?
Homer Simpson: No.
Cowboy Bob: Called me two minutes before you came in, said, 'Save the little one, I'm coming down'. Here he is. Now, do you want it or not?
Homer Simpson: All right. All right! I'll take it.
Cowboy Bob: Best decision you're ever gonna make. You're gonna... This is gonna change your life.

Marge Simpson: My feet are getting wet!

DOLPH: Five finger discount, man.
Homer Simpson: Now don't worry. Our situation isn't as bad as it seems. And you're forgetting, I'm an experienced woodsman. Now you all stay here for a minute while I go over this way and try to get my bearings.
Homer Simpson: (SADLY TO HIMSELF) What am I going to do? I've murdered us all.
Homer's Canyon Echo: (LOUDLY) I've murdered us all... us all.. us all... us all.

Lisa Simpson: (CALLING AFTER THEM) Remember, Dad. The handle of the Big Dipper points to the North Star.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) That's nice, Lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. We're in the woods.
Lisa Simpson: Should Maggie be going with them, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Oh, I don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, Lisa.
Bart Simpson: (NERVOUS) There aren't any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad?
Homer Simpson: Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
Bart Simpson: It's a deal.
Homer Simpson: And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they don't like it. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Bart Simpson: (WORRIED) Right.
Homer Simpson: (PANIC) A rattler!
Bart Simpson: (PETRIFIED) I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not...

Bart Simpson: Yeah, man.
Homer Simpson: Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town.
Bart Simpson: But dad, I'm so hungry. Can't we eat something first? I'm starving, man.

Homer Simpson: Plemk heh feh.
Newsman: (OVER CURSES) Now the naturalist who took these absolutely extraordinary pictures was most impressed by the creature's uncivilized look, its foul language, and most of all its indescribable stench.
Newsman: A popular supermarket tabloid has offered a reward of $5,000 to anyone who brings in the creature alive. Naturally, we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops. We now return you to the President's address, already in progress.

Tv Announcer #2: Last weeks capture of bigfoot has turned into the scientific poser of the century. Although the creature was ultimately released, the question remains. Who was this Homer? Was it man or was it, in fact, the legendary missing link known as Bigfoot?
Homer Simpson: Can I have some apple sauce?
Tv Announcer #2: Specialists from around the world have gathered at the Springfield Primate Institute for a firsthand examination of the controversial creature. They are now ready to announce their findings.

Homer Simpson: Oh no, no. We stink, we stink!
Marge Simpson: Homer! Were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: And now I'd like to begin today's sermon which I have entitled, "Gambling, the 8th Deadly Sin." Today is Sunday, the Lord's day and yet, at this very moment, millions of Americans are not in the Lord's house. They're in their own house worshipping a false idol, professional football. Oh Lord...
Radio Announcer #1: It's a beautiful Sunday. Perfect football weather for this incredible game. And by the way, this game is being brought to you by the good people at Duff Beer. You can't get enough of that wonderful Duff.
Radio Announcer #1: Now, they're lining up for this crucial kick. One final tick of the clock remains. If they win, it will cap an amazing comeback. But it's a 49 yard field goal into the wind.

Marge Simpson: Gambling.
Homer Simpson: Oh! He didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?
Marge Simpson: No! Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore in front of the kids. Lisa, Bart, what did you two learn in Sunday school today?
Lisa Simpson: The answers to deep theological questions..
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven.
Homer Simpson: What! Those cute little monkeys? That's terrible. Who told you that?
Bart Simpson: Our teacher.
Homer Simpson: I can understand how they wouldn't let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?
Bart Simpson: Ah, cool, man. Space Mutants 4. Drop me off! Drop me off!
Marge Simpson: No way, Jose.

Bart Simpson: Whoops! Whoops! Oh, whoops... whoops!

Bart Simpson: Hey Lis, you think that's enough for her?
Lisa Simpson: Maybe one more.
Lisa Simpson: I hope she likes the presents we got her.
Patty Bouvier: (LOW) Do you know the Heimlich Maneuver?
Bart Simpson: Well, I know she'll like mine. Who wouldn't like a bottle of real French perfume?
Bart Simpson: All the way from Gay Paree. Four bucks, plus tax.
Lisa Simpson: Well, I think she's gonna like my hand-made birthday card better.
Bart Simpson: Whoa, big deal... dry macaroni... spray paint and glue. Whoopee!
Bart Simpson: (WHISTLES)
Bart Simpson: Dibs! First dibs, I get to lick the beaters.

Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Huh? Whuh?
Lisa Simpson: Here's your birthday breakfast!
Marge Simpson: (TOUCHED) Well, isn't this nice?
Homer Simpson: My birthday?
Lisa Simpson: No!
Homer Simpson: It's my birthday? What did I get? I love birthdays.
Marge Simpson: (A LITTLE COLDLY) No, Homer. It's mine.
Bart Simpson: You don't even know your own wife's birthday?
Homer Simpson: (PANIC RAPIDLY SETTING IN) Of course I know! Sure! (TO MARGE) You really thought I forgot, didn't you?
Bart Simpson: Oh, right. What'd you get her, Dad?
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, what'd you get?
Homer Simpson: (STALLING) Huh... a very thoughtful gift. But it's a surprise. (STRETCHING) You know, it's such a beautiful morning, I think I'll take a little stroll around the block.
Lisa Simpson: I think he forgot, Mom.
Marge Simpson: Umm-hmm.
(Springfield Mall: ext. SPRINGFIELD mall - a few minutes later)

Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) Oh, Marge. He never gets you anything you want. He always gets something for himself.
Selma Bouvier: (TO PATTY) Like the tackle box.
Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) Remember when he got you the tackle box?
Selma Bouvier: (TO PATTY) And Connie Chung.
Patty Bouvier: (INTO PHONE) And when he "surprised" you with the Connie Chung calendar?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.
(THE JOCK SHOPPE: INT. THE JOCK SHOPPE)
Homer Simpson: (APPRECIATIVE) Hmmmm!

Selma Bouvier: Umm-hmm.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - foyer - a little later)
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Be right there.
Marge Simpson: Homer, we're having dinner tonight at the Singing Sirloin.

Bart Simpson: You're welcome, Mom.
Patty Bouvier: (TO MARGE) Thirty-four years old.
Selma Bouvier: (LOW, TO MARGE) Time enough to start over with a new man.
Patty Bouvier: (LOW, TO MARGE) Someone who eats with his mouth shut.
Homer Simpson: What's that, Patty?
Patty Bouvier: Nothing. Finish your steak. (LOW) Look at him wolf down that gristle.
Barney Gumble: Wow!
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: Does, too.
Bart Simpson: Does not.
Lisa Simpson: Then how comes she's not putting on any of your perfume?
Bart Simpson: Yeah. Hey, Mom. How come you're not putting on any of my perfume?
Marge Simpson: Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) I-I'm saving it... for a special occasion.
Bart Simpson: What the hell are you talking about? There's gallons of it.
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: But this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special.
Bart Simpson: Gotcha. (TO LISA) I told you she liked mine better.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, brother.
Homer Simpson: (AMIABLY) Hold on! Hold on now! Your mother hasn't opened my present yet.
4TH QUARTET OF WAITERS: (SINGING) HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! / HAPPY THIRTY-FOURTH BIRTHDAY, MRS. HOMER SIMPSON... / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOOOOO!
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Whoop! Don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. Beauty, isn't she?
Marge Simpson: Well, it's hard for me to judge (ANGRILY) since I've never bowled in my life.
Homer Simpson: (PLAYFUL) Well, if you don't want it, I know someone who does.
(Simpson Master Bedroom: INT. Marge & homer's BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT)
Homer Simpson: You always say we should talk. I'm talking right now, as a matter of fact. But I'm going to stop in a second. So, please say something back, Marge, please. I'm gonna stop talking... now.
Marge Simpson: You bought that bowling ball for you, not for me.
Homer Simpson: What? No...
Marge Simpson: The holes were drilled for your fingers.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?
Marge Simpson: You never intended for me to use that ball.
Homer Simpson: Well, if that's how you feel, I'll take it back.
Marge Simpson: You can't take it back. You had your name engraved on it.
Homer Simpson: So you'd know it's from me!
Marge Simpson: (GRIM) Homer, I'm keeping the ball. For myself.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm. I'll just use my ball.
Homer Simpson: (TAKEN ABACK) What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
Marge Simpson: (GRIM) I'm keeping it and I'm going to use it. Thank you for the present, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (PAUSE) Well... you're welcome.

Marge Simpson: (HOLDING UP BALL TENTATIVELY) Excuse me... where do I throw this?
Counter Guy: Over there.
Marge Simpson: Thank you.
Counter Guy: Hey, wait, wait a minute. You're gonna need a lane.
Marge Simpson: No, thanks. I'm just here out of spite.
Counter Guy: Can't bowl without a lane.
Marge Simpson: Hm. Well... all right.
Counter Guy: Okay, here you go. You keep score on this. What size shoes you wear?
Marge Simpson: (PRIMLY) Never you mind.
Counter Guy: (PATIENT) Can't wear street shoes on the lanes. You gotta wear bowling shoes. What size, please?
Marge Simpson: (SOFTLY) Thirteen. Double A.
Counter Guy: Thirteen double A. (WHISTLES)
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Counter Guy: This is the closest I've got.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Counter Guy: A nine and a fifteen.
Marge Simpson: Thank you. (MURMUR)
Marge Simpson: (TO HERSELF) A little warm and moist. (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Marge Simpson: (MURMUR)
Jacques: (TO GROUPIES; THICK ACCENT) So -- one hundred and twenty pins later, I am the better man.
Marge Simpson: (TO HERSELF) I don't see what he's doing that's so different from what I'm doing.
Marge Simpson: (EMBARRASSED) Oh!
Marge Simpson: I'm awfully sorry.
Jacques: Entirely my fault. (PAUSE) It is nice to meet you... (LOOKS AT HER BALL)... Homer.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge.
Marge Simpson: (SLIGHT SURPRISED GASP)
Jacques: Your fingers are so slender, so feminine. They are far too tapered for the ball you are using. You need something lighter, more delicate. Here, use my ball.
Marge Simpson: No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... (LOOKS AT THE NAME ON HIS BALL)... Brunswick.
Jacques: Call me Jacques.
Marge Simpson: Jacques.
Jacques: Marge.
Jacques: (PHILOSOPHICAL) As you wish. Many people have senseless attachments to heavy, clumsy things such as this "Homer" of yours.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm.
Jacques: May I ask you a bold question?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Jacques: You've never bowled before?
Marge Simpson: Never.
Jacques: No?
Marge Simpson: No.
Jacques: Then I will teach you.
Marge Simpson: Oh, I don't want to trouble you.
Jacques: Not at all. I am a professional. Roll the ball for me, Marge. Let me see your form.
Marge Simpson: All right. But I'm not very good.
Marge Simpson: I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them don't even wobble.
Jacques: I can help you, Marge. Pick up the ball. Pick up Homer. Pick him up.
Marge Simpson: Oh!
Jacques: Now, throw!
Marge Simpson: But...
Jacques: Throw, damn you!
Marge Simpson: (GASPS) You're a very good teacher!
Jacques: Yes, I am a very good teacher and I can teach you everything. I can tell you what the little arrows on the wood floor mean. Which frame is the beer frame. I bet you don't know how to make a five-seven-ten split, do you, Marge?
Marge Simpson: No.
Jacques: But first of all, you yell.. the eight pin is a cop.
Marge Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Jacques: Let it out, Marge. Laugh loud. Laugh out loud. You'll lose weight.
Marge Simpson: Oh, that's very funny.
Jacques: Feels good.
Marge Simpson: Oh, dear, I didn't realize there was so much to this game. What do you charge for lessons?
Jacques: (LIKE CHARLES BOYER) Twenty-five dollars.
Marge Simpson: Twenty-five dollars!
Jacques: It's a forty-dollar value.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Well... all right. When do we start?
Jacques: We have already begun.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - continuous)
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) Now this is living, eh, kids? Hot pizza... the food of kings.
Eugene Fisk: I love you, Dad.
Lisa Simpson: Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard taking care of us.
Homer Simpson: (LAUGHS) Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. (LONG BEAT AS THEY EAT) Does the time always drag like this?
(Barney's Bowlarama: int. bowling alley - continuous)
Jacques: (SENSUOUS) First you must get to know your lane. Feel the slickness. Feel the satiny finish. Caress it. Experience it. Quite smooth, isn't it?
Marge Simpson: Hm, very smooth.
Jacques: Smooth?
Marge Simpson: Yes, very.
Jacques: Yes?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: Yes.
Marge Simpson: Smooth.
Jacques: Smooth?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: Yes. You could eat off of it.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm.
Jacques: You hungry?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Jacques: (CALLING OFFSTAGE) Four onion rings!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - a little later)
Lisa Simpson: Mm! Delicioso!
Bart Simpson: (LICKING HIS FINGERS) My compliments to the delivery boy.
Homer Simpson: Okay. We've eaten, and eaten well. Now, what else do we have to do? Well, let's check the list your mom left us.
Homer Simpson: Eat, mm-hm.
Homer Simpson: Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in.
Homer Simpson: All right, we're clean. Now we'll... (CHECKS LIST) put Maggie to bed.
(Maggie's Bedroom: int. maggie's bedroom)

(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - MASTER BEDroom - continuous)
Marge Simpson: Homer... Homer.
Homer Simpson: (HALF ASLEEP) Ahhh... ahhh... Oh, how was bowling?
Marge Simpson: It's a very challenging hobby.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES SLEEPILY) Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing.
Marge Simpson: Umm-hmm. But I think I'll do much better tomorrow night.
Homer Simpson: Oh? You're going back?
(Kwik-E-Mart: ext. Kwik-E-Mart)
Marge Simpson: Well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?
Homer Simpson: (CONFUSED) Uh, no, I don't mind.
Marge Simpson: Good night, Homer.
Homer Simpson: 'Night.
(Barney's Bowlarama: int. bowling alley - next night)
Jacques: It is for you.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Jacques! It fits. You got it in my size and it has my name on it. It's really for me.
Jacques: Seventeen fifty. Enjoy it my darling.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - late that night)
Jacques: (HUMMING) Here we are.
Marge Simpson: You didn't have to drop me off.
Jacques: But I wanted to. Marge... Do you know how beautiful you look in the moonlight?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Jacques, I'm a married woman.
Jacques: (TORTURED) I know, I know. My mind says stop, but my heart and my hips cry proceed.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)
Jacques: Marge, darling, I-I want to see you tomorrow. Not at Barney's Bowl-A-Rama. Away from the thunderous folly of clattering pins. Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
Marge Simpson: What's brunch?
Jacques: You'd love it. It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end. You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal.
Marge Simpson: I don't think so.
Jacques: Marge, darling, there are ten pins in my heart. You've knocked over eight. Won't you please pick up that spare?
Marge Simpson: (A-FLUTTER) Oh! Oh! (QUICKLY) Well, all right.
Homer Simpson: Marge?
Marge Simpson: What, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (DEFEATED) Nothing.
(Simpson Foyer: int. simpson foyer - morning)
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh. School bus.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, kids. Special lunches. Lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun.
Bart Simpson: Whoa. Aye carumba!
Lisa Simpson: Are you going bowling again tonight, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Hm, yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Here's more treats. But don't worry, your dad will take care of dinner.
Bart Simpson: Mmm. Wednesday -- hoagie night.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Lisa. My darling little Lisa.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Bart. My special little guy.
(School Bus: int. school bus)
Bart Simpson: Mmmm. Great lunches, eh, Lis?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what psychologists call over-compensation. Mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing.
Bart Simpson: Hey, don't rock the boat, man. Whatever it is, we're making out like bandits.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. They go through eight separate stages. Right now, I'm in Stage Three, fear. You're in Stage Two, denial.
Bart Simpson: No, I'm not.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you are.
Bart Simpson: No, I'm not.
Lisa Simpson: Yes, you are.
Bart Simpson: Am not, am not, am not!
Lisa Simpson: (A LITTLE FRIGHTENED) I stand corrected.
(Coffee Shop: int. coffee shop - brunch time)
Jacques: Mimosa?
Marge Simpson: I'm a married woman. Please don't call me that.
Jacques: (LAUGHING) No, no, no, no, no. Mimosa is the name of the drink. It's orange juice and champagne. You're so wonderful that you thought it was something offensive.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Well, thank you.
HELEN: Marge! Marge Simpson! You remember me, don't you? I'm Helen Lovejoy, the gossipy wife of the minister.
Marge Simpson: Oh... yes, hello, Helen.
HELEN: Well, I had just finished eating and was about to leave when I looked over this way and said to myself, "Why, isn't that Marge Simpson over there? Having brunch with a man who isn't her husband?" And I just had to come over and say hello.
Marge Simpson: We're... uh...
HELEN: Oh, don't squirm on my account.
Jacques: I am giving her a bowling lesson, thank you.
Jacques: Now, Marge. Uh, the pins on the three-seven-ten split would be here. We'll make this little piece of food the ball. The ball's bigger, you know that...
Marge Simpson: Hmm-hmm.
Jacques: But for food, this is a good ball.
HELEN: Well, 'bye-bye. See you in church on Sunday, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Helen.
Jacques: Goodbye, Helen.
Mr. Fisk: I love you, son.
Jacques: You have a lovely friend, there. Let's hope something runs over her.
Marge Simpson: (LAUGHS)
Jacques: Your laughter is like music to me. But if you laugh at what I say next I will die, for I am about to say something very serious... perhaps shocking. Marge, my darling, I want you to meet with me again.
Marge Simpson: That doesn't shock me.
Jacques: Away from prying eyes. Away from the Helens of the world. At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.
Jacques: (LIKE "THE CONTINENTAL") I've been waiting for you. Come in, my captivating one.
Jacques: May I have this dance?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Marge Simpson: You certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
Jacques: (LAUGHING) I like you so much. They're not for bowling. You are so naive. They're for lovemaking.
Marge Simpson: Really!?
Jacques: Yes... Champagne?
Marge Simpson: Please.
Jacques: There, my darling.
Marge Simpson: Thank you.
Jacques: What cosmic force brought us together, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Destiny?
Jacques: Yes... Some divine pin-spotter must have placed us side by side.
Marge Simpson: Like two fragile bowling pins...
Jacques: Standing bravely...
Marge Simpson: Until inevitably...
Jacques: We must topple.
Jacques: Marge, speak to me.
Marge Simpson: Is Thursday okay?
Jacques: It's okay indeed.
(Simpson Home: int. Simpson house - master bedroom - early evening)
Homer Simpson: For Marge?
Bart Simpson: (CHEERY) Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol' apple around, huh? Sound like fun?
Homer Simpson: (EXHAUSTED) Son, I don't know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.
Bart Simpson: Aw, come on, Dad. Get the lead out.
(YARD: ext. yard - early evening)
Bart Simpson: Simpson checks the runner on first. He's cool. He's fine. Here's the windup and... here's the pitch.
Bart Simpson: Dad, you didn't even say ouch.
Homer Simpson: Oh, sorry... ouch!
Bart Simpson: Lisa, Lisa! I think you're right about Dad. Something's very, very wrong here.
Lisa Simpson: Frightened, Bart? Welcome to Stage Three: Fear.
Bart Simpson: Well, come on. We gotta do something, man.
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, Bart. I'd love to help you but I'm mired in Stage Five, self-pity.
Bart Simpson: Look, Dad. I don't know what's going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help.
Homer Simpson: I gave you advice? Get outta here.
Bart Simpson: Yeah. You did! You told me when something's bothering you, and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way you won't make things worse.
Homer Simpson: Hmm. Good advice.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - thursday morning)
Homer Simpson: (STRUGGLING FOR THE RIGHT WORDS) Marge, may I speak to you?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: You know, I've been thinking... Everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. But your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. I don't know how you do it. You've just got a gift, I guess. I've always thought so. I just never mentioned it. But it's time you knew how I feel. I don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. (BROKEN) ...Goodbye, my wife.
Marge Simpson: Goodbye, Homer.
(Jacques's Apartment: int. jacques' apartment)

Marge Simpson: So how was the office birthday party?
Homer Simpson: Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was (INDICATING WITH FINGERS) this thick. (CHUCKLES) And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance.
Marge Simpson: Does this girl like him?
Homer Simpson: Pffft. I have to warn you, Marge -- I think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Just keepin' you on your toes, babe.
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! (MOAN) I'm a blimp! Why are all the good things so tasty? From now on, exercise every morning.

Homer Simpson: Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance.
Marge Simpson: Homer, is this some kind of stag party?
Homer Simpson: No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing.
Marge Simpson: Eugene Fisk? Isn't he your assistant?
Homer Simpson: (QUIETLY) No, my supervisor.

Martin Prince: Bart, I'd really appreciate a print of your masterwork.

C. Montgomery Burns: What in blue blazes do you think you're doing, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: What do you mean, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: I mean this!
C. Montgomery Burns: A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat! This is a family nuclear-power plant, Simpson. Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women. I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans!
Homer Simpson: It won't happen again, sir. I promise. May I get out of your sight now?
C. Montgomery Burns: Just a second, Simpson! Smithers, would you leave the room for a minute?
Waylon Smithers: Yes, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret.
Homer Simpson: Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy.
C. Montgomery Burns: Simpson, I'm asking you nicely.

Homer Simpson: Look, I'm not drinking out of the carton. (BREAKING DOWN) Come on, Marge. Please forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Marge Simpson: Homer! You don't even know why you're apologizing.
Homer Simpson: Yes I do. Because I'm (PITIFULLY) hungry... my clothes are smelly... and I'm tired.
Marge Simpson: I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you.
Homer Simpson: Oh, he does not!
Marge Simpson: Yes he does, Homer. And when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. You owe your son better than that, Homer.
Homer Simpson: So what should I do, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her.
Homer Simpson: Okay. Your wish is my command, my little...

Bart Simpson: Nice to meet you, ma'am.
Homer Simpson: Could you tell him a little about yourself?

C. Montgomery Burns: You, with the hair. Down in front!
Marge Simpson: Oh, he's sunk even lower!
Homer Simpson: Quiet! I have something to say to all the sons out there; to all the boys; to all the men; to all of us. It's about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews -- well, not our nephews -- they are our mothers. And you know something, folks? As ridiculous as it sounds, I would rather feel the sweet breath of my beautiful wife on the back of my neck as I sleep than stuff dollar bills into some stranger's G-string. Am I wrong, or am I right?

Seymour Skinner: Hello, Mrs. Simpson. I'm afraid there's been a very disturbing incident at school today.
Bart Simpson: I'm outta here, man.
Marge Simpson: Homer, Principal Skinner's here.
Homer Simpson: Oh, hello Principal Skinner. I'd get up but the boy crippled me.
Seymour Skinner: Mmm-hmm. I understand completely. The disturbing incident I was referring to happened this morning, when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys' lavatory.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) That old gag.
Seymour Skinner: Unfortunately, at the same moment, my mother was in the girls' lavatory making use of the facilities.
Marge Simpson: Oh, dear.
Seymour Skinner: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, we have transcended incorrigible. I don't think suspension or expulsion will do the trick. I think it behooves us all to consider... deportation.
Marge Simpson: (AGHAST) Deportation! You mean kick Bart out of the country?
Homer Simpson: Hear him out, Marge.
Seymour Skinner: Well, perhaps I was being a tad glib. Let me explain. Our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program. Now normally, a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence, but in Bart's case I'm prepared to make a big exception. And, if you're willing to play along, he can spend the next three months studying far, far away.
Homer Simpson: Sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months.
Marge Simpson: Homer! You didn't even ask where Bart would be going.
Seymour Skinner: Actually, he'd be staying in France in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine country.
Marge Simpson: But Bart doesn't speak French.
Seymour Skinner: Oh! When he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, but what about Bart?
Seymour Skinner: I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?
Seymour Skinner: Well, for one thing, you wouldn't be getting a French boy. You would be getting an Albanian.
Homer Simpson: You mean all white with pink eyes?
Seymour Skinner: No, no, no, no. A student from Albania. It's a country on the Adriatic Sea.
Marge Simpson: Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I think Bart should have a say in this.
(Bart's Bedroom: int. bart's bedroom)
Bart Simpson: Aah, the life of a frog. That's the life for me.
Marge Simpson: Bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in France?
Bart Simpson: France? Wow.
(LIVING ROOM: int. living room)
Homer Simpson: He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off.
Seymour Skinner: Mmm-hmm.
Bart Simpson: And I'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Yes, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Wow. And one back?
Marge Simpson: Mmm-hmm. Well, Bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea.
Marge Simpson: Yes! Yes!
Seymour Skinner: Way to go!
Homer Simpson: Bon voyage, boy.

Bart Simpson: I know I'm going and you're not.
Homer Simpson: I'm gonna miss you, son. And listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. I guess what I'm saying is, don't mess up France the way you messed up your room.
Bart Simpson: Okay, Dad.

In this way, and only in this way, can we hope to better understand our backward neighbors throughout the world.
Adil Hoxha: Thank you, Principal Skinner. Thank you, fellow students.

Adil Hoxha: Can not.
Lisa Simpson: Can, too.
Adil Hoxha: Can not.
Lisa Simpson: Can, too.
Homer Simpson: Please, please kids. Stop fighting. Maybe Lisa's right about America being a land of opportunity, and maybe Adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers.
Adil Hoxha: Your father is right. We should not fight. Friends?
Lisa Simpson: Well, okay.
Marge Simpson: Well, now that that's settled, I'll just clear the dishes.
Adil Hoxha: No, no, Mrs. Simpson. You have been oppressed enough for today. I will clear the dishes.
Marge Simpson: Oh. Okay.
Homer Simpson: Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing.
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Lisa Simpson: Your paper-thin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine. May I be excused?
Marge Simpson: Lisa!
Homer Simpson: Oh, she's just jealous. She'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her. (LAUGHS)

Adil Hoxha: Then I can go?
Homer Simpson: Well, I'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in Security, but sure, you bet.
Adil Hoxha: (TENTING FINGERS) Excellent.

Cesar: Now watch me. (DEMONSTRATING) You grab the grape between your thumb and forefinger and gently twist it off and drop it in the bucket.
Cesar: Now you do it.
Cesar: Very good. Now do it a million times.

Adil Hoxha: Dad, do you think I might see your plutonium isolation module?
Homer Simpson: Uh... maybe. Hold on a second.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Lenny. Does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals?
Lenny Leonard: Yeah, over in Sector Twelve.
Homer Simpson: Sector Twelve?
Lenny Leonard: Third floor by the candy machines.
Homer Simpson: Oh, that Sector Twelve.
Homer Simpson: Come along, Adil.

Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, COUGHING) Yeah, right.
Cesar: (IN FRENCH) Silence!
Marge Simpson: Everyone here in the United States is fine. We think Maggie may say her first word any day now. Lisa got an A in Math, which I'm only mentioning as news -- I'm not putting you down. And your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you.

UGOLIN: Prison? Oh, my. (IN FRENCH: En prison? Oh, non!)
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Sideshow Bob.
Cesar: (CHUCKLING) Whenever I find my faith in a higher power shaken, I always think of the miracle of anti-freeze. Too much can be poison. (POURING SOME IN) But the right amount gives wine just the right kick. (IN FRENCH: Quand je sens que ma foi dans les forces supremes faiblit, je pense toujours au miracle de l'antigel. Si on en met trop, blen sur, c'est du poison. (POURING) Mais dans les proportions voulues, ca donne du corps au vin.)
UGOLIN: You put in too much. It may kill someone. (IN FRENCH: Je pense que tu en par trop. Tu vas tuer quelqu'un avec ca.)
Cesar: Kill someone? Don't be ridiculous. (IN FRENCH: Tuer quelqu'un? T'es fou!)
Cesar: What are you doing? Get out of here.
Bart Simpson: Sorry.
Cesar: On second thought, Bart, Bart, come here. (TO UGOLIN) Watch, I bet it won't even blind him. (IN FRENCH: Regarde. Je te parie que ca va meme pas le rendre aveugie.)
Cesar: Drink this.
Bart Simpson: Uh, no thanks.
Cesar: Do not worry. This is France. It is customary for children to take a little wine now and then.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there.
Cesar: Drink it!
Bart Simpson: (BURPS)
Cesar: (TO UGOLIN) He sees well enough. Now, go buy a case of anti-freeze. (IN FRENCH: Qu'est ce que je t'avais dit? Maintenant, va nous chercher une caisse d'antigel au magasin.)
UGOLIN: But it is raining outside. Let's make the wine tomorrow. (IN FRENCH: Mais il pleut. Est qu'on peut attendre et faire le vin demair?)

Bart Simpson: Aw, forget it. (TO HIMSELF) I'm so stupid. Anybody could have learned this dumb language by now. Here I've listened to nothing but French for the past (STARTS SPEAKING IN FRENCH) deux mois, et je ne sais pas un mot. Eh! Mais, je parle francois maintenant. Incroyable!

These two guys I'm staying with work me night and day, they don't feed me, they make me sleep on the floor, they put anti-freeze in the wine, and they gave my red hat to the donkey.)
Gendarme: Anti-freeze in the wine? That is a very serious crime. Come along, boy. There is nothing for you to fear now. (IN FRENCH: De l'anti-gel dans le vin? Ah, mais c'est serieux, ca. Viens avec moi, fiston. Tu n'as plus rien a craindre.)

Homer Simpson: Oooo.
Cia Agent #1: Mmm-hmm. Through the use of radio triangulation, we tracked him to exactly this point.
Homer Simpson: Wow!
Cia Agent #1: That's all I can tell you.
Homer Simpson: Aw!

Homer Simpson: Hmmm.
Cia Agent #2: (INTO BULLHORN) Time's up, Sparrow. We're coming in after you.

Bart Simpson: Same here.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd love a glass of that wine Bart brought us.

Krusty the Clown: Well, happy birthday, Brittany. How do you want to celebrate? Do you want me to sing you a birthday song?
Sideshow Bob: (BLOWS HIS WHISTLE ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
Krusty the Clown: Or do you want me to shoot Sideshow Bob out of a cannon? (LAUGHS)
Sideshow Bob: (BLOWS HIS WHISTLE DOWN)
Lisa Simpson: (CHANTING) The cannon. The cannon. The cannon. The cannon.
Brittany: The cannon.
Krusty the Clown: (SHRUGS) Sorry Sideshow Bob, but it's her special birthday wish.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING) You're doomed, Sideshow Bob.
Krusty the Clown: I know we haven't had much luck shooting you out of this cannon, but maybe that's because we haven't used enough gun powder!
Krusty the Clown: Brittany, do the honors.
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGH) Don't blame me --
Lisa Simpson: I didn't do it!
Bart Simpson: Comedy, thy name is Krusty.

Homer Simpson: How you doin', Apu?
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... (GASPS) New flavor! Triple chocolate!
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: What's the matter, sir? Never have I seen you look so unhappy while purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.
Homer Simpson: The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, "the gruesome twosome." (CHUCKLES)
Krusty the Clown: Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy....
Homer Simpson: (TURNING AROUND) Sorry, pal...
Homer Simpson: (GASPS)
Krusty the Clown: Hand over all your money in a paper bag.

Announcer: Springfield's number one news team with our Emmy award winning anchorman, Kent Brockman.
Scott Christian: Good evening. I'm Scott Christian. Kent Brockman is off tonight. Why did the clown cross the road? To rob a Kwik-E-Mart.
Scott Christian: The news story behind that enigmatic half-joke right after this commercial message.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
Bart Simpson: Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?
Homer Simpson: He's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?
Bart Simpson: Are you kidding? He's my idol. I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings.

Scott Christian: And just in... actual footage of the crime taken with the Kwik-E-Mart security camera.
Homer Simpson: The reason I look unhappy is that tonight I have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as I call them, "the gruesome twosome." (CHUCKLES)
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Patty Bouvier: So, the truth comes out.
Krusty the Clown: Hand over all your money in a paper bag.
Bart Simpson: Oh... oh! Krusty, how could you?
Marge Simpson: I know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? Maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along.

Krusty the Clown: Buy my cereal. (LAUGHS)
Krusty the Clown: I didn't do it.
Bart Simpson: I wish I could believe you.
Kent Brockman: Good evening again, Springfield. Krusty the Clown, the beloved idol of countless tots, now nothing more than a common alleged criminal. His trial, which begins tomorrow, has taken center ring in a national media circus as children of all ages, from eight to eighty, hang on each new development like so many Rumanian trapeze artists.
Kent Brockman: From his humble beginnings as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi...
Kent Brockman: Krusty clowned his way to the top of a personal mini-empire --
Kent Brockman: -- with dozens of endorsements, including his own line of pork products. This may have led to one of television's best-loved bloopers -- Krusty's near fatal on-the-air heart attack in 1986.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, son. You'll understand one day.
(Moe's Tavern: INT. MOE'S TAVERN)
Krusty the Clown: Wasn't that a great Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, kids? Well, we've got another one coming right up, but first I got a hankerin' for some pork products.
Krusty the Clown: Mmmm. Look! Plump succulent sausage, honey-smoked bacon and glistening, sizzling...(GASPING SOUND)
Krusty the Clown: I'm dying! I'm dying!
Kent Brockman: But a quick triple bypass and a pacemaker later, Krusty bounced back. However, he was a changed clown. Where his show had been condemned by parents and educators alike as simple-minded TV mayhem...
Kent Brockman: This new Krusty devoted a small portion of every show to stamping out illiteracy in today's anything-for-a- thrill youth.
Krusty the Clown: Give a hoot! Read a book!
Kent Brockman: Krusty's arrest has sent shock waves through Springfield, packing its churches, synagogues and mosques with disillusioned citizenry from all walks of life.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: I urge every halfway decent member of our community to gather up all merchandise that bears the likeness of Krusty, that clown prince of corruption, and join me in a public burning.
Kent Brockman: So is Krusty the Clown about to trade in his baggy pants for the relatively snug uniform of Springfield Penitentiary? We'll find out tomorrow when his trial begins.
(Springfield Courthouse Steps: ext. springfield courthouse steps - day)

Bart Simpson: And his feet... they're so small.
Bart Simpson: Say it ain't so, Krusty.

Krusty the Clown: I didn't do it!
(Courtroom: int. courtroom - day)

Krusty the Clown: I plead guilty, your honor.
Krusty the Clown: (LAUGHS) Uh... I mean, not guilty. Opening night jitters, your honor.
District Attorney: I would like to call to the stand, Homer J. Simpson.
Bart Simpson: Don't do it, Dad. Please don't do it.
Bart Simpson: He's innocent, I tell you. Krusty would never do something like that. Ah come on Dad, you gotta listen to me.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
District Attorney: Mr. Simpson, was that you taking that cowardly dive into that display of heavily-salted snack treats?
Homer Simpson: Yes, sir.
District Attorney: Hmmm hmmm. Do you recognize the gunman in this courtroom today?
Homer Simpson: Yes, I do.
District Attorney: Fine, would you point him out to us?
Homer Simpson: Okay.
Bart Simpson: Oh, man.

Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Good people, I'm so happy you're all here tonight. But please, just a few words of caution. Now, we are going to set this pile of evil ablaze, but because these are children's toys the fire will spread quickly, so please stand back and try not to inhale the toxic fumes.

(Courtroom: int. courtroom)
District Attorney: Krusty, would you please turn your attention to Exhibit B, and tell me what you see?
Krusty the Clown: (NERVOUSLY) Which one do you mean?
District Attorney: The one with the big B on it.
Krusty the Clown: (PITIFULLY) Uh... uh...
District Attorney: What's the matter, can't you read?
Krusty the Clown: (BREAKING DOWN INTO TEARS) No, I can't! I can't read or write! I admit it! I'm totally illiterate! Now are you happy?
Judge Snyder: (TO KRUSTY) Can it be that the champion of child literacy can't even read himself?
Krusty the Clown: Is it a crime to be illiterate?
Bart Simpson: So?
Bart Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, Al. Last name, Koholic.
District Attorney: All right, all right. See this, Krusty? This is a 'B'. And this is Exhibit B. Betting slips, obtained by this court indicating you have lost substantial sums of money on sports gambling --
Krusty the Clown: Is it a crime to bet on sporting events?
District Attorney: Yes, it is.
Krusty the Clown: Oh.
Judge Snyder: Foreperson, have you reached a verdict?
Foreperson: Yes, we have, your honor. We find the defendant, Krusty the Clown... guilty.
Lawyer: (COMPLETELY LOSING HIS COOL) I knew it! This happens to me every time.

Sideshow Bob: My young friends. For years I have been silent, save for the crude glissandos of this primitive wind instrument. But now destiny has thrust me into the center ring. In the coming weeks, you will notice some rather sweeping changes in our program. Please, do not be alarmed. Itchy and Scratchy will still have a home here, but we will also learn about nutrition, self-esteem, etiquette and all the lively arts.
Bart Simpson: What the hell are you doing, Lis?
Lisa Simpson: I'm watching Sideshow Bob. You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be.
Bart Simpson: You backstabber, you traitor, you...
Lisa Simpson: (SLAPS BART IN THE FACE) Snap out of it, Bart. Face the facts. All those hours we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook.
Bart Simpson: Look, Lisa, I know Krusty's innocent. Don't ask me why. It's just a feeling I have.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Lisa. I think I can prove Krusty's innocent, but I need your help.
Lisa Simpson: You do? Why?
Bart Simpson: Oh, come on Lis, you know why.
Lisa Simpson: No, why?
Bart Simpson: (RELUCTANTLY) I'll never forgive you for making me say this, but... you're smarter than me.

Lisa Simpson: Don't you remember the get-well card we sent to Krusty? It was after his heart attack, when he had a pacemaker put in.
Bart Simpson: Ah ha!
Lisa Simpson: Wait a minute. Krusty can't read.
Bart Simpson: (CRACKING) Okay! okay! So the poor guy can't read! Can't we get off his back already?
Lisa Simpson: No! Don't you get it, Bart? How could Krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Hey, hey. This is not a lending library. If you're not going to buy that thing, put it down or I'll blow your heads off.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I'm starting to think you're right. Krusty was framed. Did he have any enemies?
Bart Simpson: I don't know, but I know someone who would: Krusty's best friend in the whole world, Sideshow Bob.

Sideshow Bob: What's your name, young man?
Bart Simpson: Bart Simpson, sir.
Sideshow Bob: Mmm... Well, perhaps we can shed some light on your problem in a new segment exploring pre-adolescent turmoil. I call it "Choices."
Bart Simpson: I don't think so, sir.
Sideshow Bob: Bart, I'm reaching out to you.
Sideshow Bob: So what's on your mind, Bart? I bet the other children don't accept you.
Bart Simpson: True, Sideshow Bob, but that doesn't bother me. You see, my sisters and I have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like Krusty was framed.
Sideshow Bob: (NERVOUS) Framed?
Bart Simpson: Well, the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the Kwik-E-Mart. But Krusty couldn't go near the thing. Not with his pacemaker.
Sideshow Bob: Well, you know Bart, as much as I love Krusty, he was never one to take doctors' orders too seriously.
Bart Simpson: Well, maybe. But, get this, Krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the Springfield Review of Books.
Sideshow Bob: Ah, well, Bart...
Sideshow Bob: The fact is, you don't have to be able to read to enjoy the Springfield
Sideshow Bob: Review of Books. Just look at these amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag.
Bart Simpson: Yeah, I guess those are kinda funny.
Sideshow Bob: Bart, (TO AUDIENCE) children, this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us, but we must get on with our lives. Let's try to remember Krusty not as a hardened criminal, but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car.
Bart Simpson: (GOING ALONG) And shot you out of a cannon.
Sideshow Bob: (BITTERLY) And shot me out of a cannon. Yes, we will never forget that will we? (THEN) Bart, open your heart. I admit I have some mighty big shoes to fill, but if you give me a chance, I promise you won't be disap...
Sideshow Bob: (ECHOING) Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill. Big shoes to fill.
Sideshow Bob: You know, in ancient Greece, there was a school of thought called stoicist...
Bart Simpson: (OUTRAGED) Wait a minute! You did it!
Sideshow Bob: Excuse me?
Bart Simpson: Attention, fellow children. Krusty didn't rob that store. Sideshow Bob framed him and I got proof.
Sideshow Bob: Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy...
Bart Simpson: See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes but he's got little feet, like all good-hearted people.
Bart Simpson: Sideshow Bob really fills his shoe with big ugly feet.
Lou: The kid's right.
Eddie: How do you figure we missed that?
Chief Wiggum: Get off your duffs, boys. Get down to that studio!
(TELEVISION STATION: ext. television station)
Sideshow Bob: Yes, I admit it. I hated him. His hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years. I played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites. That's why I framed Krusty. I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for these meddling kids.
Bart Simpson: Take him away, boys.
Sideshow Bob: Treat kids as equals. They're people too. They're smarter than you think. They were smart enough to catch me.
(Jailhouse: ext. jailhouse - day)
Chief Wiggum: Well, we made a terrible, terrible mistake. Uh... won't happen again.
Krusty the Clown: It better not, you dimwit.
Homer Simpson: Krusty, I'm man enough to admit I was wrong, and I'm sorry I fingered you in court. I sincerely hope that the horrible stories I heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (THRU RADIO) Okay... let's see... next we have...
Krusty the Clown: Well, the important thing is that I regained the trust of the children, but there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart?
Bart Simpson: Yes, sir.
Krusty the Clown: Thank you.

Homer Simpson: Hey, turn it up. I love hearing those whack-os.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) Tell me about your husband, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Well. (INTO PHONE) When we were dating he was sweeter, and more romantic, and forty pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) What was that last thing you said?
Worker One: Hey, isn't that your wife, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Don't be ridiculous. My wife worships the ground I walk on.

Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE; WORRIED) Ohhh.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) Your husband sees you as nothing.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh. Okay, well thank you.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: (INTO MICROPHONE) No, no, don't hang up! The pig has made you into his mother. You are not the hot love object you deserve to be.
Marge Simpson: Really?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: I'm as sure of it as I'm sure my voice is annoying. Marge, tonight, the second he comes through that front door, you've got to tell him you're fed up. And if he doesn't start loving, you'll be leaving.
Marge Simpson: Leave Homer?
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Please. Don't use his real name.

Moe Szyslak: Hey, you can level with me. You got a domestic situation?
Homer Simpson: (CONTEMPLATES HIS EGG, THEN JAMS IT IN MOUTH) You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.
Moe Szyslak: Homer?
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) What?
Moe Szyslak: Marge is right. You are a pig. You can ask anyone in this bar.
Homer Simpson: What? (YELLS) Hey, Barney, am I a pig?
Barney Gumble: (DRUNKENLY) You're no more of a pig than I am. (BURP)
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, no.
Moe Szyslak: See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.
Homer Simpson: Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that.

Bart Simpson: Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Louis Stevenson? And published by the good people at McGraw Hill.
Bart Simpson: So in conclusion, on the Simpsons' scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine.

Homer Simpson: (CHEWING) Mmmm. Marge, Could you get me another beer, please?
Marge Simpson: In a second, Homer. Lisa has some good news.
Lisa Simpson: He doesn't care, Mom.
Homer Simpson: Sure I do. I just want to have a beer while I'm caring. Marge...
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED) Homer! Go ahead, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: Well, okay. I got an A on my vocabulary test.
Homer Simpson: (OVER ENTHUSIASTICALLY) What! You did! Well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! Lisa, hand me your paper.
Homer Simpson: I'm just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. Well as long as I'm here, I might as well kill two birds with one stone.
Bart Simpson: (OUTRAGED) What's the big idea? You covered up my paper.
Homer Simpson: (CHORTLING) Look at those funny little whiskers. (SNAPPING FINGERS) Oooo! That reminds me. It's Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. C'mon boy.
Bart Simpson: No, Dad, I should really... Whoop!
(LIVING ROOM: int. living room)
Homer Simpson: (GASPS) Oooh, "Gorilla, The Conqueror." The granddaddy of them all.
Bart Simpson: (UNEASILY) Ah well, maybe just one more hour.
Homer Simpson: (SNIFFLING, TEARY) It's so unfair... just because he's different.
Bart Simpson: Well, time to hit the books.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLING) Burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? Go get 'em.

Bart Simpson: Hey, Otto-man. I've got a big test that I am not ready for. Could you please crash the bus or something?
Otto Mann: Oh, sorry little buddy. Can't do it on purpose. But hey, maybe you'll get lucky.
Bart Simpson: (UNDER BREATH) Okay, no reason to panic. Find an egghead, pump him for some answers, and boom, I'm back on easy street.
Sherri Mackleberry: (UNDER BREATH) Look at him. I bet he didn't study again.
Terri Mackleberry: And now he's gonna try to kiss up and get answers from us.
Sherri Mackleberry: He's pathetic.
Bart Simpson: Good morning, girls.
Terri Mackleberry: Good morning, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Say... who's up for a little cram session? I'll go first. What was the name of the pilgrim's boat?
Terri Mackleberry: The Spirit of St. Louis.
Bart Simpson: And where did they land?
Terri Mackleberry: Sunny Acapulco.
Bart Simpson: Why'd they leave England?
Terri Mackleberry: Giant rats.
Bart Simpson: Cool. History's coming alive.

Martin Prince: As a natural enemy, I don't know why I should care, but the information pertaining to America's colonial period that you just received is erroneous.
Bart Simpson: So you're saying...
Martin Prince: A blindfolded chimp with a pencil in his teeth has a better chance of passing this test than you do.
Bart Simpson: (GROANS) Thanks for the pep talk.

Homer Simpson: (WHISPERS) I have hair!... (LOUD) I have hair!
Milhouse Van Houten: (OVER PHONE) Nothing much. Lewis made Richard laugh milk through his nose.
Bart Simpson: (ON PHONE - NOT VERY INTERESTED) Oh, you don't say? What about that history test?... Huh? (A LITTLE SINISTER) Piece of cake, huh? So listen, what'd you get for Number one? (WRITES IT DOWN) Uh huh. Number two?... Oh yeah, that sounds right.
(CLASSROOM: int. classroom - day)
Bart Simpson: (COYLY) Here you go, Mrs. Krabappel. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Dr. J.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I think what we have on our hands here is a classic case of what laymen refer to as fear of failure. As a result, Bart is an underachiever. And yet he seems to be... how should I put this...? Proud of it?
Homer Simpson: (NODDING) Hmmm...
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: One of his problems may be his short attention span, which can lead to...
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Blah, blah, blah... blah, blah, blah, blah. (PAUSE)
Homer Simpson: Hmmm huh.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah ... (PAUSE)
Homer Simpson: Hmmmm
Bart Simpson: (SHRUGGING) No.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Every other student in the class has shown at least some form of improvement and yet you continue to struggle. Why is that?
Bart Simpson: I dunno.
Bart Simpson: (WILD EYED) Okay... okay! Why are we dancing around the obvious? I know it. You know it. I am dumb. Okay? Dumb as a post. Do you think I'm happy about it?
Marge Simpson: There, there, Bart. You're just a late bloomer.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: Oh... I wish it were that simple. As shameful and as emotionally crippling as it may be, I'm afraid my recommendation is for Bart Simpson (BEAT) to repeat the fourth grade.
Bart Simpson: What! You can't hold me back. I'll do better, I promise.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe it would help him to be left back. It won't be so bad, Bart.
Bart Simpson: No, I mean it. You can't hold me back. I swear I'm gonna do better. Look at my eyes. See the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade.
Homer Simpson: And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids.
(School Bus: INT. SCHOOL BUS - MORNING)
Otto Mann: Get off the bus or forever hold your peace, little dudes.
Bart Simpson: Otto, you know I respect you. I mean you always let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns...
Otto Mann: Damn thing never goes over, does it?
Otto Mann: So what's in your head, little man?
Bart Simpson: (WRINGING HANDS) Well, I've been failing a lot of tests recently.
Otto Mann: (VERY DIM) Yuh huh.
Bart Simpson: And now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade if I don't shape up.
Otto Mann: (NODDING) That's it? Hey, relax man. It could end up being the best thing that ever happened to you. I got held back in the fourth grade myself -- twice. And look at me, man. (WITH PRIDE) Now I drive the school bus.
Dr. J. Loren Pyror: I'm afraid my recommendation is for Bart Simpson to repeat the fourth grade. (ECHOEY) Repeat the fourth grade. Repeat the fourth grade. Repeat the fourth grade.

Kid: Long John Silver, Dad.
Bart Simpson: (ANGRILY) Thanks a lot, son.
(Springfield Elementary School Yard: ext. schoolyard - recess)
Bart Simpson: Yo! Little help!
Bart Simpson: I said little help! Throw me the ball, Poindexter.
Martin Prince: Oh, I'm sorry, Bart. I'm unfamiliar with the rules of your sport. I didn't want to interfere with a ball in play.
Martin Prince: Well, back to the forecastle of the Pequod.
Bart Simpson: Hm, hey, Martin.
Homer Simpson: I have hair! Look! Look!
Martin Prince: (BACKING AWAY) You have your ball back. I have nothing else of value.
Bart Simpson: I need you to help me get a passing grade.
Martin Prince: Well, you do need someone's help to get a passing grade but I don't know why that someone should be me.
Bart Simpson: Because I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.
Martin Prince: (TAKEN ABACK) They... laugh at me? I'd always considered myself rather popular.
Bart Simpson: You're not. Watch!
Martin Prince: Then my-my speed with numbers... my years of service as a hall monitor... my prize winning diaramas... these things mean nothing to them?
Bart Simpson: Perhaps another demonstration.
Martin Prince: Very well. You have made your point, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Then it's a deal.
Martin Prince: Yes.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - stairway)

Martin Prince: Yes, your-your sanctuary from the hurly-burly of modern life.
Bart Simpson: Well, there's a desk under that junk over there.
Martin Prince: Oh. No, no, no, no. This won't do at all. We're gonna have to clean up this room. And we'll clearly need a few ferns in here. No study area is complete without adequate plant-life.
(School Bus: int. school bus - day)
Bart Simpson: No.
Martin Prince: No?
Bart Simpson: Only geeks sit in the front seat. From now on you sit in the back row. And that's not just on the bus. It goes for school and church, too.
Martin Prince: Why?
Bart Simpson: So no one can see what you're doing.
Martin Prince: Oooh. I think I understand. The potential for mischief varies inversely with one's proximity to the authority figure.
Bart Simpson: Well yeah, but don't say it like that.

Lisa Simpson: (TO HERSELF) Prayer, the last refuge of a scoundrel.
Bart Simpson: A teacher's strike, a power failure, a blizzard. Anything that'll cancel school tomorrow. I know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do it, you can. Thanking you in advance, your pal, Bart Simpson.

Lenny Leonard: Homer, don't be a sap all of your life. Just fill out a few medical insurance forms creatively. Charge that Dimoxinil stuff to the company.
Homer Simpson: But it's a thousand bucks... Burns would can my butt in no time flat.
Lenny Leonard: Ooooh, a thousand bucks. So what? To Mr. Burns, that's one less ivory back scratcher.

Executive #1: A round of layoffs might wake up the idiots.
Executive #1: We could put caffeine in the water cooler.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well those are my ideas! You people don't think, you regurgitate. That's why I promoted someone who's in touch with the workers. You!
Executive #3: I think you mean him, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: You then! How would you improve the worker situation?
Homer Simpson: Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks.
C. Montgomery Burns: Fish sticks? What in blazes are you talking about?
Homer Simpson: Well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them.
C. Montgomery Burns: I know what fish sticks are! Get to the point!
Homer Simpson: Well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and I always run out.
Waylon Smithers: Will you stop wasting our time, Simpson?
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up, Smithers. Can't you see what he's saying? A happy worker is a busy worker. Three cents worth of tartar sauce could save us thousands of man-hours in labor. I like the cut of your jib, Simpson. (PAUSES, TENTING HIS FINGERS) Let the fools have their tar-tar sauce!
Homer Simpson: Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. Brilliant. Who could have ever imagined that Simpson's sweeping reforms would pay off so quickly?
Waylon Smithers: You know, sir, accidents decreased by exactly the number that Simpson himself is known or suspected to have caused last month. And our output level was just as high during Simpson's last vacation.
C. Montgomery Burns: My dear tired old Smithers, do I detect a note of jealousy?
C. Montgomery Burns: It is time. Give Simpson the key.

Homer Simpson: (GASP) The key!
Karl: Stunning. Absolutely stunning.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hey ho, men. You know I was watching the DuMont last night and I happened to catch a fascinating documentary on Rommel, the Desert Fox. Now there's a man who could get things done.
C. Montgomery Burns: Towel please, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Allow me, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: I said, Simpson!
Waylon Smithers: But...
Homer Simpson: Sure thing, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me down the hallway.
Homer Simpson: Can do, sir.
Waylon Smithers: (READING FORM) A thousand dollars, Dimoxinil, "Keep brain from freezing." Now I've got you, Simpson.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON)
Marge Simpson: Homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?
Homer Simpson: Rainy day. There's never gonna be a be a rainy day, Marge. There's not a cloud in the Simpson sky. And what does my little girl want?
Lisa Simpson: An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
Homer Simpson: Yea... eh... how about a pony?
Lisa Simpson: Okay.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - BURNS' OFFICE - DAY)
C. Montgomery Burns: I want you to weave that patented Simpson magic with my executives. A short speech, work work work, you know.
Homer Simpson: Uh, well okay, what the hey?
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. Set you to your task, Simpson.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns, it is my sad duty to report that one of your executives has bilked the company insurance plan out of a thousand dollars.
C. Montgomery Burns: What! Blast his hide to Hades! (BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED) And I was going to buy that ivory back scratcher! How did he do it?
Waylon Smithers: He charged the company for dimoxinil. It's a baldness cure.
C. Montgomery Burns: Thank you very much, Professor Science! I know what dimoxinil is. Now go and make an example of this hooligan.
Waylon Smithers: With pleasure, sir.
Homer Simpson: Karl, you gotta help me. Mr. Burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?
Waylon Smithers: Oh, just thought I'd drop by to tell you that... you're fired.
Homer Simpson: What?
Waylon Smithers: Our company does not look kindly upon one thousand dollars worth of insurance fraud. Clean out your desk by noon, Simpson.
Karl: Wait! (PAUSE) Mr. Smithers, Homer Simpson is innocent. I did this.
Homer Simpson: You did?
Waylon Smithers: What are you talking about?
Karl: Mr. Simpson was unaware of any impropriety. I take full responsibility.
Waylon Smithers: (DISAPPOINTED) Really. Oh, well then, you're fired... whoever you are.
Karl: (WRITING CHECK) Here's your thousand dollars.
Waylon Smithers: (TO KARL) Hey, what do you care if this guy's bald?
Karl: My reasons (PAUSE) are my own.
Homer Simpson: Karl, you saved me. Why?
Karl: Have I done something extraordinary here today? No. I did what I was born to do, what any good soldier would have done when a live grenade threatened his commander. I threw myself upon it and bore its terrible brunt.
Homer Simpson: Well, thanks, Karl. I don't know what to say.
Karl: Just walk me to my car.
Homer Simpson: Bye, Karl. I'm gonna miss you.
Karl: Bye, Mr. Simpson.
Karl: Oh, Mr. Simpson, did you bring an umbrella today?

Bart Simpson: It's like, realsville, Daddy-o.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS)
Homer Simpson: Bart, what are you doing?
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Why you little...
Bart Simpson: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Ahhhh!
Homer Simpson: Boy must die.
Bart Simpson: (CHOKED UP) I love you, Dad.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary.
Marge Simpson: Homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --
Homer Simpson: I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Lisa Simpson: (TO BART) Dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING)
Marge Simpson: Oh Homie, I'm so sorry.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - HOMER'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING)
Waylon Smithers: You've got that big speech in five minutes, Simpson. Huh, you're not gonna hang yourself, are you? (CHUCKLE)
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Karl: Dear Mr. Simpson: I have taken the liberty of preparing your speech on the enclosed numbered three-by five cards. All the big words are spelled (SLOWLY) phon-et-ic-al-ly. God bless you. You are one of Springfield's very special creatures. Your obedient servant, Karl. Good luck, sir.
Homer Simpson: Karl! So that wasn't just a sweet voice I heard inside my head. What are you doing here?
Karl: I just came to say goodbye to the gals in the typing pool.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, well, thanks for the speech, Karl, but I can't give it. (DISTRAUGHT) Look at me!
Karl: I guess I haven't taught you anything.
Homer Simpson: What do you mean?
Karl: Don't you see? The tartar sauce, the bathroom key -- drying your boss's hands. You did it all! It was never the hair. You did it, because you believed you could, and you still can.
Homer Simpson: No, I can't. I'm just a big fool.
Karl: Oh no, you're not.
Homer Simpson: How do you know?
Karl: Because my mother taught me never to kiss a fool.
Homer Simpson: Karl.
Karl: Now go get 'em, tiger.
Homer Simpson: (GROWL)
C. Montgomery Burns: And now, with some fresh insights, one of the rising young stars of our nuclear family, Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: What in blazes? Who is that old geezer? And what has he done with Homer Simpson?
Waylon Smithers: (CHUCKLING) He is Homer Simpson, sir.
Homer Simpson: A lot of you would think I was crazy if I did this.
C. Montgomery Burns: He's crazy!
Homer Simpson: Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of...
Homer Simpson: (STRUGGLING) Five thousand two... I mean... (GIVING UP) Lots of money.
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns' office. Right now.
Waylon Smithers: Dead man comin' through.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to.
Homer Simpson: Uh, why?
C. Montgomery Burns: (BEAT) Simpson, how old do you think I am?
Homer Simpson: I don't know... a hundred and two?
C. Montgomery Burns: I am only eighty-one. You may find this hard to believe... but in my salad days, my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ooh, I was big man on campus until my senior year, when I became as bald as a plucked chicken. You see, Simpson, I too know the sting of male-pattern baldness. That's why I'm giving you your old job back.
Homer Simpson: What! Oh thank you, thank you, thank you.
C. Montgomery Burns: Now get out of here before I reconsider.
Homer Simpson: Oh, better hurry up.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING)
Marge Simpson: Homer, are you still awake?
Homer Simpson: I've never been more awake in my life.
Marge Simpson: What's wrong?
Homer Simpson: Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it.
Homer Simpson: And... and?! (BARELY ABLE TO ASK) What about loving me?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer, honey. Come here.
Homer Simpson: What?!
Marge Simpson: Come here. (GRABS HIS FACE) (SINGING PASSIONATELY) "YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / (CONTINUES SINGING) CAN'T YOU SEE? / YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR /

Homer Simpson: HOMER MARGE
Homer Simpson: to me."
Marge Simpson: (CLEARING HER THROAT) Hello, everyone. (CLEARING HER THROAT) You know, Halloween is a very strange holiday. Personally, I don't understand it. Kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on T.V. that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers. Things like the following half hour. Nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which I totally wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. Thanks for your attention.
(House: ext. house - night)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute. Let's see what the kids are up to.
Lisa Simpson: ... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, "We have traced the call. It's coming from the floor below you. Get out of the house!" But it was too late. End of story.
Bart Simpson: Yawn. I heard that when I was in the third grade. It's not scary.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Is too.
Bart Simpson: Is not.
Lisa Simpson: Fine. Then you tell one scarier.
Bart Simpson: Flashlight, please.
Bart Simpson: Here's a story that's really scarifying.

Homer Simpson: Huh? (TO FAMILY - SURVEYING THE ROOM) Well... it's all ours!
Marge Simpson: I still can't believe how inexpensive it was.
Homer Simpson: Motivated seller, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Well, he certainly must have been motivated. Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this.
Homer Simpson: So we got a good deal for once. Quit fighting it.
Marge Simpson: It just seems too good to be true.
Lisa Simpson: Ow! Mom! Bart threw a book at me.
Bart Simpson: Did not.
Lisa Simpson: Did too.
Bart Simpson: Did not.

Homer Simpson: Okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one.
Lisa Simpson: (QUIETLY) I can feel an evil presence in this house.
Marge Simpson: Evil!
Homer Simpson: Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother.
Marge Simpson: Children, get your coats. We're leaving this house right now.
Homer Simpson: Now wait a minute, Marge. It's only natural there would be some things wrong with an old house like this. It's a fixer-upper. What's the problem? we get a bunch of priests in here...
Marge Simpson: I'm not going to live in a house of evil just to save a few dollars.
Homer Simpson: (GENUINELY OUTRAGED) Don't be so stubborn! We're not talking about a few dollars! We're talking about a few thousand dollars!
Homer Simpson: It's got great high ceilings.

(BEAT - SCREAMS) No you didn't! (BEAT - SCREAMS) Well, that's not my recollection... (BEAT, THEN BACKING DOWN) Yeah! Well... all right, goodbye.

Kang: I beg your pardon.

Kang: You mean this? (HOLDS UP BOOK) It's a harmless cookbook. It's just a little dusty.
Lisa Simpson: Wait a minute!
Kang: Wait, there's still more space dust on here.
Kang: (UTTER DISBELIEF) Let me get this straight. You thought...
Kodos: (ANGRY) They thought we were going to eat them.
Kang: (APPALLED) Good God! Is this some kind of joke?
Kodos: No, they're serious...
Lisa Simpson: Well, why were you trying to make us eat all the time?
Kang: Make you eat? We merely provided a sumptuous banquet and, frankly, you people made pigs of yourselves.
Serak The Preparer: I slaved in the kitchen for days for you people and...
Kang: (SARCASTIC) Well, if you wanted to make Serak the Preparer cry, mission accomplished.

(CHAMBER: int. chamber - night)
Lisa Simpson: Once upon a midnight dreary,
Lisa Simpson: while I pondered, weak and weary,
V.O.: Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Marge Simpson: Like what?
V.O.: As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
Homer Simpson: (DISMISSING) 'Tis some visitor,
V.O.: I muttered,
Homer Simpson: -- tapping at my chamber door -- Only this and nothing more.
Bart Simpson: Are we scared yet?
Lisa Simpson: Bart, he's establishing mood.
V.O.: Ah, distinctly I remember. It was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow:
V.O.: -- sorrow for the lost Lenore --
Homer Simpson: Oh, Lenore.
V.O.: For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore -- Nameless here for evermore.
Homer Simpson: Aag!
V.O.: And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me -- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating;
Homer Simpson: (TERRIFIED, CHANTING RAPIDLY) 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- This it is and nothing more.
V.O.: Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer;
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY AND OBSEQUIOUSLY) Sir --
V.O.: -- said I --
Homer Simpson: -- or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you.
V.O.: Here I opened wide the door; --
Bart Simpson: This better be good.
V.O.: Darkness there and nothing more.
Bart Simpson: You know what would have been scarier than nothing?
Lisa Simpson: What?
Bart Simpson: Anything!
V.O.: Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS) Surely --
V.O.: -- said I --
Homer Simpson: -- surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --
Chief Inspector: Mr. Burns in twenty years I have never seen such a shoddy, deplorable --
(Simpson Dining Room: int. simpsons' dining room - next evening)
V.O.: Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he, But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -- Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -- Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES, THEN FRIENDLY) Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --
V.O.: I said --
Homer Simpson: -- art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore -- Tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Bart Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Eat my shorts!
Lisa Simpson: Bart! Stop it. He says "nevermore". That's all he'll ever say.
Bart Simpson: Okay, okay.
V.O.: Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by some unseen censer,
Homer Simpson: Ouch! Censer..
V.O.: Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
Homer Simpson: (PLEADING) Wretch --
V.O.: I cried --
Homer Simpson: -- thy God hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. (GETTING TEARY) Respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: (ANOTHER ANNOYED GRUNT, THEN) Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!
V.O.: I shrieked of starting,
Homer Simpson: Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Oh, leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! -- quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!
V.O.: Quoth the Raven,
Raven: Nevermore.
Homer Simpson: Why you little --!
Raven: Uh-oh.
Homer Simpson: Come back here now, Raven
Bart Simpson: Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore.
(GARAGE: INT. GARAGE - DAY)
V.O.: And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting, On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, Shall be lifted -- nevermore!
(Bart's Treehouse: INT. TREE HOUSE)

Lisa Simpson: My brother's using worms but I who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing.
Dave Shutton: I see. And uh, what's your name, son?
Bart Simpson: I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Dave Shutton: (CHUCKLE) I'm Dave Shutton. I'm an investigative reporter who's on the road a lot, and uh, I must say that in my day we didn't talk that way to our elders.
Bart Simpson: Well, this is my day and we do, sir.
Bart Simpson: All right! We eat tonight!
Dave Shutton: Wait a minute. (STARTS COUNTING) One, two, three.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - morning)
Marge Simpson: Well leave it to good old Mary Bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
Homer Simpson: (SNORTS) Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.
Homer Simpson: Like getting Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. (DERISIVELY) President's Day! Pfft. What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out --
Marge Simpson: You're late for work, Homer.
Homer Simpson: So... Someone will punch in for me.
Lisa Simpson: Try not to spill anything, Dad.
Bart Simpson: Keep those mutants comin', Homer.
Homer Simpson: I'll mutant you.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - day)
Homer Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. (MUMBLING TO HIMSELF) Why can't I ever get here on time?
C. Montgomery Burns: (OVER P.A.- FRIENDLY) Hi, ho, faceless employees. In a few moments the government inspection team will be touring your plant so look busy and keep your mouths shut. That is all.
(SECURITY CLEARANCE BOOTH AT POWER PLANT: ext. security clearance booth at power plant)
Waylon Smithers: Very stirring, sir.
Waylon Smithers: Uh oh. Here they come.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hold me, Smithers.
Chief Inspector: (TO TEAM) Okay men, Geiger counters on.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES WEAKLY) I suppose that's normal background radiation? The kind you would find in any well-maintained nuclear facility? Or, for that matter, playgrounds and hospitals.
Chief Inspector: Sorry.
(COOLING TOWER: EXT. COOLING TOWER - DAY)
Chief Inspector: (WHISTLES) Gum used to seal crack in cooling tower.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm as shocked as you are.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - work station)
Chief Inspector: Plutonium rod used as paperweight.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Now, that shouldn't be.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISMISSING) Yeah. Well that's always been like that.
Homer Simpson: (WAKENS WITH A SHRIEK) Uh, uh, just resting my eyes.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, well done. A rested employee is a vigilant employee.
Chief Inspector: Monitoring station unmanned.
(Other Part of Nuclear Plant: int. another part of power plant)
C. Montgomery Burns: Look here, Inspector. Could I speak to you privately I-in my office?
(Burns's Office: INT. BURNS' OFFICE)
(Burns's Living Room: int. burns' living room - that night)
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, look! Some careless person has left thousands and thousands of dollars just lying here on my coffee table. Uh, Smithers, why don't we leave the room and hopefully, when we return the pile of money will be gone.
C. Montgomery Burns: (THROUGH HIS TEETH) Look Smithers, the money and a very stupid man are still here.
Chief Inspector: Burns, if I didn't know better I'd think you were trying to bribe me.
C. Montgomery Burns: Is there some confusion about this?
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Take it! Take it, take it, you poor schmoe.
Chief Inspector: Mr. Burns, I am going to overlook this felony. However, I will not overlook the three hundred and forty-two violations I have observed at your plant today. Either bring this place up to code or we'll shut it down. Good-day.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, well... a little dab of paint here, a little spackle there... how much could it possibly cost to fix this place up?
Waylon Smithers: Hmmm, approximately fifty-six million dollars, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Fifty-six million!
Waylon Smithers: (FRIGHTENED) Don't hit me, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (DEFEATED) Oh, that I had the strength to take it out on you, Smithers. Now please go. I would be alone.
C. Montgomery Burns: (MELANCHOLY SINGING) ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / MADE IT RUN / MADE IT RACE AGAINST TIME/ ONCE I BUILT A RAILROAD / NOW IT'S DONE / BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME./ HALF A MILLION BOOTS WENT SLOGGING THROUGH HELL / I WAS THE KID WITH THE DRUM.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. power plant - outside secondary monitoring station)
C. Montgomery Burns: Empty! Bah!!
Homer Simpson: Ah! (WAKING) Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. (LOOKS AT HIS WATCH) Holy moly! Nine-thirty.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me.
Homer Simpson: Echo, echo... (ECHO CONTINUES) (CHUCKLE)
C. Montgomery Burns: (SINGING) HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / THEY CALLED ME AL / IT WAS AL ALL THE TIME / HEY DON'T YOU REMEMBER / I'M YOUR PAL / BUDDY, CAN'T YOU SPARE A DIME.
(ROLLS ROYCE: int. rolls royce - night)
Homer Simpson: (TAPPING ON CAR WINDOW) Huh? What th... Uh, Mr. Burns?
C. Montgomery Burns: (STARTLED) Ah!
Homer Simpson: (SMALL SCREAM) Sorry, sir. It's just me, Homer Simpson. Is everything all right?
C. Montgomery Burns: Working late, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Uh... uh yes, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: You and I are a dying breed, Simpson. I'm going to share something with you. Hop in.
Homer Simpson: (BOUNCING ON SEAT) Ooooh, cushy.
C. Montgomery Burns: Homer, they're trying to shut us down.
C. Montgomery Burns: They say we're contaminating the planet.
Homer Simpson: Well, nobody's perfect.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why can't the government just get off our backs?
Homer Simpson: You know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently.
C. Montgomery Burns: (ANGRILY) Oh, get off your soapbox, Simpson! Do you realize how much it costs to run for office? More than any honest man can afford.
Homer Simpson: I bet you could afford it, though.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) Uh... don't get me wrong. I mean you're an honest man. I just meant that you could afford to run for governor, if you felt like it. 'Course I'm just rambling because... uh... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true. I mean, if you were governor, you could decide what's safe and what isn't.
Homer Simpson: Where are we going, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: To create a new and better world.
Homer Simpson: (TIMIDLY) If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?
Homer Simpson: Well, he's got my vote.
Marge Simpson: Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.
Homer Simpson: Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns.
Lisa Simpson: (BEAMING) Oooo, a political discussion at our table. I feel like a Kennedy.
Marge Simpson: Well, frankly, I don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against Mary Bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known.
(Burns's Office: int. BURNS' OFFICE - DAY)
Dean Danielson: Now, here's the problem as I see it: While Governor Bailey is beloved by all, ninety-eight percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse. That's why we've assembled the finest campaign team money can buy. (POINTING TO EACH AS HE GOES) This is your speech writer...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your joke writer...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your spin doctor...
C. Montgomery Burns: Huh uh.
Dean Danielson: your make-up man...
C. Montgomery Burns: Yeah.
Dean Danielson: and your personal trainer.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oooo!
Dean Danielson: Their job... to turn this Mr. Burns...
DANIELSON: ...into this.
C. Montgomery Burns: Why are my teeth showing like that?
DANIELSON: Because you're smiling.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah. Excellent. This is exactly the kind of trickery I'm paying you for. But, but how do we turn your average Joe Sixpack against Mary Bailey?
DANIELSON: With this team of investigators: your muckraker...
C. Montgomery Burns: How do you do.
DANEILSON: Your character assassin...
C. Montgomery Burns: Nice to meet you.
DANEILSON: your mudslinger...
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah...
DANIELSON: your garbologist.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello!
DANIELSON: Their job is to turn Mary Bailey from this...into this.
C. Montgomery Burns: Visual aids help so much. Thank you.
DANIELSON: But first, there's a burning issue that we need to address and neutralize immediately.
C. Montgomery Burns: I hate that fish!
(Springfield Retirement Castle: int. springfield retirement home)
TV Announcer: (FROM TV) Thank you for watching Movie for a Dreary Afternoon. Please stay tuned for a paid political announcement brought to you by the Friends of Montgomery Burns.
Grampa Simpson: Burns! Change the channel.
Jasper Beardly: You change it.
Grampa Simpson: No, you change it.
OLD BEARDED GUY: I changed it last week.
Grampa Simpson: Fine. Be a jerk. Then we'll just sit here and watch it.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Barney Gumble: (RE: TV) Oh, no. An election! That's one of those deals where they close the bars, isn't it?
Moe Szyslak: (NODS) Sorry, Barney.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Marge Simpson: I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
(TV Studio: int. tv studio)
Waylon Smithers: Thirty seconds to air, Mr. Burns.
DANIELSON: Now, remember to smile.
C. Montgomery Burns: I am smiling.
DANIELSON: You'll have to do better than that.
C. Montgomery Burns: (GRUNTS TWICE) How's this?
DANIELSON: There you go.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm going to be sore tomorrow.
DANIELSON: Well, we've done all we can, Mr. Burns. The rest is up to you.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, don't worry --
C. Montgomery Burns: -- by the time this paid political announcement is done, every Johnny Lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hand.

(Springfield Retirement Castle: int. springfield retirement home)
(Studio: int. studio)
C. Montgomery Burns: (INTO CAMERA, REALIZING) Oh, hello friends. I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor, and I'm here to talk to you about my little friend, here. Blinky.
C. Montgomery Burns: Many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation. Nothing could be further from the truth. But don't take my word for it. Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin what he thinks.
Charles Darwin: Hello, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh hello, Charles. Be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection.
Charles Darwin: Glad to, Mr. Burns. You see, every so often Mother Nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth, sharper claws, longer legs or, in this case, a third eye. And if these variations turn out to be an improvement, the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the face of the earth.
C. Montgomery Burns: So... you're saying this fish might have an advantage over other fish. It may, in fact, be a kind of super fish!
Charles Darwin: I wouldn't mind having a third eye, would you?
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) No. You see, friends... if our anti-nuclear naysayers and choose-up-siders were to come upon an elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant, they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman.
C. Montgomery Burns: The truth is this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that can't be beat. Mmmm mmmm. So, to summarize: Say what you want about me. I can take the slings and arrows. But stop slandering poor, defenseless Blinky. Good night and God bless.
Singers: ONLY A MORON/ WOULDN'T CAST HIS VOTE/FOR MONTY BURNS.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Barney Gumble: Wow! Super fish!
Moe Szyslak: I wish the government would get off his back.
(Springfield Retirement Castle: int. springfield retirement home)
Grampa Simpson: That Burns is just what this state needs... young blood.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - LIVING ROOM)
Homer Simpson: I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey.
Marge Simpson: Homer... (PINS ON BAILEY BUTTON) I'm a Bailey Booster.
Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a Burns Booster. (PINS ON BURNS BUTTON; STICKS HIMSELF) Ow!
(Burns's Office: INT. BURNS' OFFICE)
DANIELSON: Congratulations, Mr. Burns. The latest polls show you're up six points.
C. Montgomery Burns: Giving me a total of...
DANIELSON: Six. But we're on our way!
MARY BAILEY: My worthy opponent seems to think that the voters of this state are gullible fools. I, however, prefer to rely on their intelligence and good judgment.
C. Montgomery Burns: And I say taxes are too high!
C. Montgomery Burns: Have you found any dirt on Mary Bailey?
Investigator #1: Well, we've gone through her garbage...
Investigator #2: We've talked to her maid...
Investigator #1: And so far, the only negative thing we have found is from some guy who dated her when she was sixteen.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, and?
Investigator #3: He felt her up.
C. Montgomery Burns: Bah! Not good enough!
C. Montgomery Burns: We're gonna send - a message - to those bureaucrats - down there in the State Capital!
Bart Simpson: Is your boss Governor yet?
Homer Simpson: Not yet, son. Not yet.
DANIELSON: The voters now see you as imperial and God-like.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hot dog!
DANIELSON: But there's a downside to it. The latest polls indicate you're in danger of losing touch with the common man.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SARCASTIC) Oh, dear. Heaven forefend.
DANIELSON: Which is why the night before the election, we want you to have dinner at the home of one of your workers.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh. I get your angle. Every Joe Meatball and Sally Housecoat in this God-forsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with Eddie Punchclock. The media will have a field day!
DANIELSON: The only question is -- can we find someone common enough...
C. Montgomery Burns: (DISGUSTED) Well, I... I knew there would be sacrifices.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen)
Homer Simpson: (CRUNCH) Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner.
Marge Simpson: What!
Homer Simpson: And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them.
Bart Simpson: Cool man! A media circus.
Marge Simpson: Absolutely not!
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Huh uh. I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT, THEN FIRMLY) Kids, please leave the room. I don't want you to see this.
Bart Simpson: Uh oh.
Homer Simpson: (DROPPING TO KNEES) Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
DANIELSON: We're hoping that one of the children might pop up with a question about the upcoming election. (HANDS LISA A PIECE OF PAPER) Little girl, do you think you can memorize this by dinner time tomorrow?
Lisa Simpson: (READING OFF PAPER) "Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?"
DANIELSON: Very good.
Lisa Simpson: Hmmm. Well as long as I'm asking something, can I ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?
DANIELSON: No, dear. The card question will be fine.
Marge Simpson: Well I think the non-card question is a valid one.
Homer Simpson: Marge! (TO DANIELSON) Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) Only an innocent child could get away with such blasphemy. God bless them all. Amen.
DANIELSON: And finally, Mr. Burns wants you to appear very affectionate to him. But we must remind you, he hates being touched.
(Simpson Home: Ext. Simpsons house - night - establishing)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Marge, get back in bed.
Marge Simpson: No, I'm just fine right here.
Homer Simpson: What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.
Marge Simpson: Well, I don't feel like snuggling.
Homer Simpson: What's that got to do with it?
Marge Simpson: I don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.
Homer Simpson: But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve.
Marge Simpson: (DEADLY CALM) Okay, Homer. Fair enough. You got it! All right! Good! That's it. That's how I'm gonna express myself. That's right. Goodnight.
Homer Simpson: Huh?
Make-up Man: Well, what do we think?
Homer Simpson: Hey! Hello, handsome!
DANIELSON: Hey, get that stuff off his face. We're here to have dinner with the common man, not Tyrone Power.
Gregor: The latest polls are in. It's dead even -- fifty-fifty. This cornball stunt is gonna put us over the top.
Bart Simpson: Whoa! He's here!
(House: ext. house - front door)
C. Montgomery Burns: Hello, Homer. Marge, you look (PAUSE) dazzling. Oh, and look, I've brought noodle kugel.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) Bad dog! Bad neighbor dog! Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns. (GRUNTS)
C. Montgomery Burns: (LAUGHING) I love dogs... babies, too.
C. Montgomery Burns: Aaaah... kitty, kitty.
Homer Simpson: Are you all right, Mr. Burns?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, of course. (THROUGH HIS TEETH) A little roughhousing with the pets is good for a man's appetite.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room)
DANIELSON: (TO BURNS) The latest polls are in. The statesman-like way you handled the pet incident has put you over the top. You're ahead fifty-one to forty-nine. Congratulations, Mr. Governor!
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent.
Homer Simpson: (TO BART) Bart, would you like to say grace?
Bart Simpson: Dear God, we paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothin'.
(PRESS BOX: INt. PRESS BOX)
DANIELSON: (TO GREGOR) He's smokin'. He's smokin'.
Homer Simpson: (MOUTH FULL, READING) "You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I (BURP) feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"
C. Montgomery Burns: (FEIGNING SURPRISE) Goodness! I didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate.
Homer Simpson: I was only reading what the card...
C. Montgomery Burns: (OVERRIDING HIM) Homer, I agree with you and, if I'm elected governor (GESTICULATES WILDLY), I will lower taxes whether those bureaucrats in the State capital like it or not.
C. Montgomery Burns: Lisa, do you have a question you would like to ask your Uncle Montgomery?
Lisa Simpson: Yes, sir. A very inane one. (SIGHS, THEN, SLOWLY DYING INSIDE) Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?
C. Montgomery Burns: Oooh, a tough question, but a fair one. Lisa, there's no single answer. Some voters respond to my integrity. Others are more impressed with my incorruptibility... still others by my determination to lower taxes, and the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Mom, that felt awful.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, dear. It will all be over soon.
Lisa Simpson: But Mom, we've become the tools of evil.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt.
C. Montgomery Burns: ...some can't even get a fair shake, or even a square deal... Ummmm, smells delightful.
Bart Simpson: All right! Three eyed fish!
Marge Simpson: Can I have your plate, Mr. Burns?
DANIELSON: Ruined before it hit the ground.
Reporter #1: Get me the city desk...
Reporter #2: (INTO PHONE) Here's your headline, Phil: "Burns Can't Swallow Own Story."
Scott Christian: The latest polls indicate Burns' popularity has plummeted to earth like so much half-chewed fish.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO DANIELSON & GREGOR) You must have a few tricks left up your sleeves. (ROLLS UP SLEEVES) Smithers, boil some coffee. We're not licked yet.
DANIELSON: Yes, we are. Come on boys, the old guy's finished.
C. Montgomery Burns: (RISING FRENZY) Wait! Come back! You can't do this to me! I'm Charles Montgomery Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, tip over this table for me!
Waylon Smithers: Yes sir.
Marge Simpson: (LOW) Homer... Homer... make them stop.
Homer Simpson: (CLEARS THROAT THEN, VERY POLITELY) Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns...
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up and wreck something.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Burns, I hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SIGHS) She's right. Take me home, Smithers. We'll destroy something tasteful.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS) Ironic, isn't it Smithers? This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one to go to jail. That's democracy for you.
Waylon Smithers: You are noble and poetic in defeat, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO HOMER) Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled.
Bart Simpson: Uh oh. You're busted, Dad.
Homer Simpson: Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled! Oh no. I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better. Please. Can't you make it better, huh?
Marge Simpson: Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you did it!
(Moe's Tavern: int. Moe's tavern - night)
Barney Gumble: So, Homer. What happened in Capitol City?
Homer Simpson: Aw, Barney.
Moe Szyslak: Come on, Homer. We're dyin' of curiosity.
Homer Simpson: Look, there's only one thing worse than being a loser. It's being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me.
Barney Gumble: Please, Homer.
Moe Szyslak: C'mom, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Well, okay. It all started on "Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night," down at Springfield stadium.
(STADIUM: ext. stadium - evening)

Homer Simpson: You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.
Bart Simpson: What? Aren't we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers?
Homer Simpson: Sure, we get a nice mix here.
Lisa Simpson: I can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. There's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy.
Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here.
Marge Simpson: I hope you'll space out the tubs this year, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) What are you getting at?
Marge Simpson: Well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire.
Homer Simpson: Marge, (HOLDING UP THE TICKET) this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, the Gammills. Good to see you.
GAMMILL: You're an inspiration to all of us in waste management, sir.

C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS) Put a little smile on his card, Smithers.
Waylon Smithers: Already there, sir.
Waylon Smithers: (WHISPERING) The Simpsons, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, well, if it isn't the Simps.
Homer Simpson: Uh... Simp-sons, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONSULTING CARD) Huh? Hmmm, oh, oh yes... Homer and Marge Simpson. Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa and uh, "Expecting".
Waylon Smithers: (SOTTO) The card needs to be updated, sir.

Homer Simpson: What's the matter, boy?
Bart Simpson: He wouldn't sign my ball.
Marge Simpson: Well, he's a fine role model. Bart, give me that ball!

FLASH: Hey there, little lady. What can Flash do for ya?
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Bart.

Homer Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Thanks, everybody.
P.A. Announcer: (HEAVILY ECHOED) Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out tonight's first ball, the man whose name is synonymous with our nation's safest and cleanest energy source, Mr. Montgomery Burns!
Waylon Smithers: Ah, they love you, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Heh, heh. As well they might. You know, Smithers, when I was a young buck, my patented fadeaway pitch was compared by many to the "trouble ball" of the late great Satchel Paige. Spit on this for me, Smithers.
Waylon Smithers: One hocker coming up, sir.
Bart Simpson: What a lame-o!
Waylon Smithers: I could actually hear the air being torn, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, shut up.
Homer Simpson: Hey, Burns! Hey, "Rag Arm"!
Bart Simpson: You throw like my sister, man!
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, you throw like me.
P.A. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, to honor America, will you please rise for our National Anthem...sung tonight by Springfield's rhythm `n' blues sensation, "Bleeding Gums" Murphy.
Dan Hoard: (INTO MIKE) Hi-de-hi, Springfield! Dan Hoard, mikeside. Tonight -- our Isotopes take on the pesky Shelbyville Shelbyvillians. The 'Topes are looking to snap that darn twenty-six game losing streak, longest in professional baseball. How 'bout that? -- Our sleepy town is in the record book!
C. Montgomery Burns: Ah, sitting with the employees. I guess this proves I'm their friend. (THEN) You did get me something on an aisle, Smithers? I don't want to be surrounded by them.
Homer Simpson: Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!
Bart Simpson: We want a pitcher / Not a belly itcher!
Lisa Simpson: We want a catcher / Not a belly scratcher!
Waylon Smithers: Here we are, sir.
Homer Simpson: (SOTTO) Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! (GRUMBLING) Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks...

Homer Simpson: Delicious frosty beer. Fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man Burns.
Marge Simpson: (WARNING) Now, Homer.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO HOMER) I suppose you want a beer?
Homer Simpson: Me, sir? Oh, no. Not a chance. Only idiots drink beer.
C. Montgomery Burns: Actually, I was wondering if you'd join me. My treat.
Homer Simpson: Ohhh. Well, if someone of your stature can enjoy a beer, maybe I'm all turned around on the subject. Wait a minute, we're not having a drug test tomorrow, are we?
C. Montgomery Burns: No. (TO VENDOR) Vendor, two, please.

C. Montgomery Burns: Oh well, I used to rile the late, great Connie Mack with that one at old Shibe Park.
Homer Simpson: (CHANTING) LITTLE BABY BATTER / CAN'T CONTROL HIS BLADDER! (LAUGHS)
Homer Simpson: Will you shut up, I'm trying to think of a name.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. Crude, but I like it. (THEN, HOLDING UP 72 OZ. TUB) What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos?
Homer Simpson: Don't mind if I do.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, Simpsie, you up for another wave?
Homer Simpson: All right, Burnsie.
Dan Hoard: Bases loaded. 'Topes have one out, down by three. Here's the pitch. Swung on and missed! Strike three. Of course.
C. Montgomery Burns: Damnation! These banjos couldn't carry Pie Traynor's glove.
Dan Hoard: Big Bill McCloskey coming up. As soon as he pops out, we'll go right to the post-game show.
Homer Simpson: C'mon! All we need is a grand slam.
C. Montgomery Burns: My one game of the year... ruined by pathetic incompetence.
Homer Simpson: What's wrong with you people? Let's show some spirit! Come on, get up!
Homer Simpson: (TO THE CROWD) Your team needs you! C'mon!!!
Homer Simpson: As I got up in front of them, I felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. It was the intoxication of being a public spectacle.
Dan Hoard: ... There's some nut down in right field, dancin' up a storm! He's really got the crowd goin'. Let's see if he can shake up mediocre slugger "Big Bill" McCloskey.
Dan Hoard: Swung on and belted to deep left field! It's going... going...
Dan Hoard: It's gone! It's outta here! Oh, my God, the Isotopes win a game! The Isotopes win a game! The Isotopes win a game!
Waylon Smithers: Well, that was certainly exciting.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes. Unfortunately, Homer Simpson's shameless display of exhibitionism tainted the entire evening. I want him banned for life from all company outings.
Waylon Smithers: (LAUGHS)
(Parking Lot: ext. parking lot - moments later)
Homer Simpson: I thank you. You're too kind. Glad you enjoyed it, but I can't take all the credit. The batter did his part, too.
MR. O'HARA: Excuse me... You, sir -- the dancing fella. I'm Antoine "Tex" O'Hara. I own the Isotopes. Would you be interested in becoming our official mascot?
Homer Simpson: M-- me? A mascot for a bush league team?
Homer Simpson: I should have slept on it. Or at least stared blankly for a while. Perhaps if I'd been unable to think of a nickname, all our lives might have been spared.
Homer Simpson: Well, I'm ready to punch in.
Bart Simpson: Oh, oh. Hey, cool, man.
Lisa Simpson: Our lives have taken an odd turn.
Marge Simpson: Did the team ask you to dress like that, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Nope, this was my own bright idea. (THEN) C'mon, we gotta hurry. Don't fill up on those vegetables, kids. Save room for your nachos.
Homer Simpson: For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me.
Dan Hoard: 'Topes win! 'Topes win! Two in a row! Two in a row!
Marge Simpson: A Simpson on a T-shirt. I never thought I'd see the day.
Homer Simpson: Oooh, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie. Woo, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.
Player #2: Hey, knock that off or I'll stick this bat where the sun don't shine.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah? And where might that be? (REALIZING) Oh.
Homer Simpson: Helen, I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. How 'bout giving me "Baby Elephant Walk" with a little reggae kinda beat?
Rasta #1: Go, "Dancin' Homer"! Git up man, git up!
Rasta #2: Lively up yourself, Dancin' Homer.
(BALLPARK: ext. ballpark - evening)
Dan Hoard: Bases loaded, two outs. The good guys trail by a run.
Dan Hoard: Here's the pitch... swung on and missed -- strike three. (DEPRESSED) 'Topes lose... 'Topes lose...'Topes lose...
(OWNER'S OFFICE: int. owner's office - minutes later)
Homer Simpson: You wanted to see me, "Tex"?
MR. O'HARA: Homer, now we both knew when you began doing this you weren't gonna be here forever...
Homer Simpson: (INTERRUPTING) Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick.
MR. O'HARA: Homer, I'm not firing you. I just got the word -- You've been called up to Capital City.
Homer Simpson: Me? In the majors?
MR. O'HARA: That's right.
Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, Capital City has a mascot. The greatest mascot there is: The Capital City "Goofball".
MR. O'HARA: Yeah, but he's getting on in years and he needs someone to fill in for a couple of innings a night. Could be a big opportunity for you.
Homer Simpson: I'll say!
MR. O'HARA: Why don't you talk it over with your family?
Homer Simpson: (WHINING) Because they might say no.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's bar - continuous)
Homer Simpson: This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should've listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.
Homer Simpson: I shouldn't have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. (BITES TONGUE) Oooh.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson HOUSE - LIVING ROOM)
Lisa Simpson: I can't leave Springfield. I was born here and I thought I would die here.
Homer Simpson: It won't be so bad. You'll die someplace else.
Bart Simpson: Well, what am I supposed to do about friends?
Homer Simpson: Phfft. You'll make new and better friends.
Lisa Simpson: But, Dad. We're simple people with simple values. Capital City is too big and too complex. Everyone in Springfield knows us and has forgiven us.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd be lying if I didn't say that this scares me a little. But we all have a calling, a reason The Almighty put us on this Earth. And yours might be to dance on dugouts.
Homer Simpson: You mean -- ?
Marge Simpson: Let's do it, Homer!
Bart Simpson: Yeah, let's blow this pop stand and never look back.
Lisa Simpson: Whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
Homer Simpson: It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: int. nuclear plant - day)
Supervisor: Sure. What would you like -- four years? Five years?
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
NED: So, Simpson. You're really moving to Capital City?
Homer Simpson: That's right, Ned.
NED: (INDICATING STUFF ON LAWN) Uh huh. And all this stuff is for sale, huh? You know, I-I-I... don't know how to say this, but, well...
Homer Simpson: Oh, knock it off, Flanders! Don't start blubbering on me. I'm gonna miss you too... (UNDER IS BREATH) not.
(Bart's Treehouse: int. treehouse - day)
Milhouse Van Houten: I don't know, Bart. I mean, I'm gonna miss you and all, but...
Bart Simpson: Come on, Milhouse. This way we'll be friends forever.
Milhouse Van Houten: Well, okay.
Milhouse Van Houten: Ewww!
Bart Simpson: I'm gonna miss you, spit brother.
Milhouse Van Houten: I'm gonna miss you, spit brother.
(Springfield Elementary School Yard: ext. schoolyard - another section)
Lisa Simpson: I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, my leaving would actually have meant something.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
Marge Simpson: Well, we have one quick stop and then it's on to Capital City.
Patty Bouvier: I can't believe it. Our baby sister in the big city.
Selma Bouvier: I'll call you every day.
Patty Bouvier: I'll call you, too.
Patty Bouvier: Look, he can use a horn.
Selma Bouvier: (TO HOMER) Oh, shut up.
(BALLPARK: ext. ballpark - night)
Homer Simpson: ... Some may say that I have been given a bad break in life -- little education, bald as a cue ball, ten years on the same job for the same salary -- but today, as I leave for Capital City, I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the Earth!
Homer Simpson: With the fickle fans already forgetting me, I was ready to take the biggest step of my life.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(Highway: ext. highway - day)
(Capital City: ext. capital city - night)
Homer Simpson: Well kids, there it is, Capital City.

Lisa Simpson: Capital City -- yeah!
(Hotel Room: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: Awww. Come to bed, Homie.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, honey. I'm just a little nervous.
Homer Simpson: We would talk about it always. For the first time in our lives, Marge fell asleep before I did.
(Capital City Cap Dome: ext. capital city cap dome - dusk)
Homer Simpson: Okay, here are your tickets. They're supposed to be good. You're sitting with the player's wives. And don't forget to cheer for me.
Marge Simpson: See you after the game, when you're a big star.
Homer Simpson: Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.
(CAP CITY DOME: INT. CAP CITY DOME)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Wow.
Homer Simpson: Omigod! I don't believe it. It's really you, the Capital City "Goofball."
Capital City Goofball: Hello, Dancin' Homer. Glad to have you aboard. If there's anything I can do for you (POINTS TO HIS BIG NOSE) just squeeze the wheeze.
(Locker Room: int. locker room - evening)
Capital City Goofball: The fifth inning will be yours. Everyone is settled in, they've had a coupla beers; the game is official. It's a pretty important inning.
Homer Simpson: Wow, the fifth.
Capital City Goofball: It's also the inning I wish I had a zipper on the front of this thing, if you know what I mean.
Homer Simpson: Right, Mr. Goofball.
Capital City Goofball: Hey, call me plain ol' "Goof". So what exactly do you have planned for us?
Homer Simpson: Well, I get up, I dance, I spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of Baby Elephant Walk.
Capital City Goofball: Aah, Mancini. The mascot's best friend. Well, see you on that field. I'll set 'em up, you knock 'em down.
(CAP DOME: int. cap dome - almost gametime)
Dave Glass: Well, hello, everybody. Dave Glass talkin' at ya. We've got great weather here tonight under the Dome.
Marge Simpson: Let's see. Upper, upper, upper mezzanine. Hmmm. Yes, these must be ours.
Bart Simpson: These seats stink!
Marge Simpson: You'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action.
First Wife #3: Actually, this section is for the player's ex-wives.
First Wife #1: (TO WOMAN NEXT TO HER) And then I found out that all the while there was this bimbo in Kansas City.
First Wife #3: Throw at his head!
Homer Simpson: Who'd've thought it? A free ticket to a big league park but I was too tense to enjoy the game. Every ounce of concentration I possessed was focused on the task at hand.
Hot Dog Man: Red hots! Get your read hots here!
Homer Simpson: Oooh, red hots.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen. Capital City's newest sensation, Dancin' Homer!
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Mmm, these do taste better at the ballpark. (WITH HIS MOUTH FULL) Uh oh.
Lisa Simpson: (POINTING) There he is!
Homer Simpson: I was graceful. I was witty. Brother, I was somethin'.
Homer Simpson: But they didn't care.
Bart Simpson: What's with these people? Why are they sitting on their hands?
Lisa Simpson: Mom, what's he doing wrong?
Marge Simpson: I don't know.
Homer Simpson: It was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
Spectator #1: This guy doesn't make me want to cheer.
Spectator #2: Gee, I really pity him. Making a fool of himself in front of so many people.
Spectator #3: These cornball antics may play in the sticks, but this is Capital City!
Homer Simpson: The only applause I got was for dragging my carcass out of there.
Clubhouse Attendant: Hey, Mr. Showmanship! The owner wants to see you in his office right now.
Dave Rosenfield: I'm sorry, young man; you're just not ready. Pick up your check at the front office... and for God's sake, put some clothes on!
(STADIUM: ext. stadium - players and mascot entrance)
Bart Simpson: Well, I guess it's back to good old Springfield.
Marge Simpson: Would you like some fruit juice?
BURNS LAWYER: No.
Lisa Simpson: But I can't go back! Not after I've seen the bright lights of Capital City. I'll wither and die like a hothouse flower.
Marge Simpson: Now stop it you two. And don't look too down. I'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
Homer Simpson: What a family.
(Freeway: ext. freeway - night)
Homer Simpson: My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern)
Homer Simpson: (SIGHS) So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude.
Barney Gumble: Wow.
Moe Szyslak: What a saga.
Homer Simpson: Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention.
Barney Gumble: Yeah, it's riveting. (BURP)
Moe Szyslak: Tell it again, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
Moe Szyslak: I don't know. They just do.
(Simpson Front Yard: EXT. SIMPSON front yard - SATURDAY AFTERNOON)
Homer Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.

Bart Simpson: You heard the lady, Homer. So please mow quietly. Genius at work.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's bedroom)
Bart Simpson: (WRITING) "One o'clock -- still just a potato.
Homer Simpson: (NOT REAL FRIENDLY) H'lo, Flanders.
Ned Flanders: Doing a little yard work, huh?
Homer Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Who told? (CALLING TO MARGE) Marge! Beer me!
Ned Flanders: Say Simpson, I-I've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif.
Homer Simpson: Crabgrass? What are you talking about? Where?
Ned Flanders: Well, (POINTING) ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there.
Homer Simpson: (DEFENSIVE) There's nothing wrong with crabgrass! It just has a bad name, that's all. Everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass.
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Well, you may be right!
Homer Simpson: (HOLLERING) Marge! Where's the Duff?
Homer Simpson: (THROUGH HIS TEETH) Don't toy with me, woman.
Ned Flanders: Couldn't help overhearing, Simpson. I've got some ice-cold suds in the rumpus room, if you'd like to join me.
Homer Simpson: Well, uh, okay. What the heck, I've earned a little break.
(Flanders Home: int. flanders house - basement/rUMPUS ROOm - continuous)
Homer Simpson: Holy moly! It's... it's... beautiful!
Ned Flanders: Say, that's right. This is your first visit to the Flanders homestead.
Homer Simpson: Well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, (COUNTING ALL OF HIS FINGERS) one, two, three, four... eight years.
Ned Flanders: There's my little Popcorn Ball. Kissy, kissy.
Maude Flanders: Hello, Sponge Cake. I thought you boys might be hungry, so I whipped up some club sandwiches.
Ned Flanders: Ain't she wonderful, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?
Ned Flanders: Oh, your beer. Uh, is draft okay? Just put in the tap last week.
Ned Flanders: Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland.
Homer Simpson: Well, beggars can't be choosy.
Todd Flanders: Hey, Dad, thanks for helping me with my science project. (KISSES HIS FATHER)
Ned Flanders: My pleasure, Study Buddy.
Todd Flanders: I've got the best Dad in the whole world.
Ned Flanders: (CHIDING) Oh, you know how that embarrasses me.
Todd Flanders: I know. T'oodley doodley.
Ned Flanders: (TO HOMER) Ah, kids can be a trial sometimes.
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) All right, knock it off!
Ned Flanders: Uh, knock what off, Simpson?
Homer Simpson: You've been rubbing my nose in it since I got here. Your family is better than my family. Your beer comes from farther away than my beer. You and your son like each other. Your wife's butt is higher than my wife's butt. You make me sick!
Ned Flanders: (FORMALLY) Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand.
Homer Simpson: I wouldn't stay on a bet!
Homer Simpson: One for the road.
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: Homie, quit tossing.
Bart Simpson: Play it where it lays, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Sorry, Marge. But it's just that I'm still steamed up about that jerk Flanders. (GRUMBLING) Lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off...
Marge Simpson: What exactly did he say?
Homer Simpson: Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!
Marge Simpson: Well, how did he say it?
Homer Simpson: (MUTTERING) Well... he...
Marge Simpson: Was he angry?
Homer Simpson: No.
Marge Simpson: Was he rude?
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay. It wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'm your best friend, but I've gotta say, I've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor.
Homer Simpson: Oh, he's perfect now, is he?
Marge Simpson: Well, he's not perfect, but he is very...
Homer Simpson: No, no, Marge. Don't backpedal. You were right the first time. He's perfect. Perfect in every way.
Homer Simpson: I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited. (POINTED) I'm not perfect... like Ned Flanders.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)

Maude Flanders: Neddie, you're tossing. What's the matter?
Ned Flanders: I feel terrible.
Maude Flanders: Mmmm, hmmm...
Ned Flanders: Sometimes I forget that we have things a little better than the Simpsons. I drag him over here. He has a few beers. You can't blame him for erupting.
Maude Flanders: Mmmm, hmmm.
Ned Flanders: And then I turn into a snarling beast. Talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
Maude Flanders: Well, Ned, maybe I'm not the one you should be talking to.
NED: You're right.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Reverend Lovejoy.
(Lovejoy Bedroom: int. reverend lovejoy's bedroom)
Helen Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) No, this is Mrs. Lovejoy. Just a minute. (TO REVEREND) Honey, honey, wake up. It sounds like Ned Flanders is having some sort of crisis.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Ugh, probably stepped on a worm. (INTO PHONE) Hello, Ned.
Ned Flanders: Hey, there's Homer Simpson! Oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) Reverend, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour but I threw a man out of my house today. I feel like I've violated Matthew 19:19.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) Huh?
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) "Love thy neighbor."
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (INTO PHONE) Oh. Oh. Matthew, 19:19, yeah, right, right. Well, you know, Ned. The Good Book says a gentle answer turneth away wrath.
Ned Flanders: (INTO PHONE) A gentle answer. Well, that is a jim-dandy idea. Bless you, Reverend.
Ned Flanders: (WRITING) "Dear Neighbor..."
(Simpson Home: ext. Simpson house - night)
Homer Simpson: Flanders!
Ned Flanders: I don't blame you for being upset with me, Homer. I just wanted to give you this letter. I'll leave now.

Homer Simpson: (READING, LAUGHING) "You are my brother. I love you (LAUGHS) and yet I feel a great sadness (BEAT) in my bosom."
Homer Simpson: Wait! Wait! There's more...
Marge Simpson: I think it's terrible. A man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
Homer Simpson: (READING, LAUGHING) "Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders."
Bart Simpson: What a sap!
Lisa Simpson: Read the bosom part again, Dad.
Marge Simpson: Now, just a minute.
Bart Simpson: (LAUGHING) Bosom!
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Huh?
Marge Simpson: I wish this family was as close as the Flanders.
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay, all right, all right. She's right! Let's do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?
Bart Simpson: All right!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm. I was going to wash my hair.
Lisa Simpson: And I'm studying for the Math Fair. If I win, I'll bring home a brand new protractor.

Homer Simpson: I know, I know. I can still make this for five. (CONCENTRATES) Come on, baby, pleeze pleeze go in. Pleeze. (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Ned Flanders: Hi, Simpson! Having fun?
Homer Simpson: Flanders! What are you doing here?
Ned Flanders: Ah, just playing a little mini-golf with the Todd-meister.
Todd Flanders: (FRIENDLY) Hi, Bart!
Bart Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Get bent.
Ned Flanders: Say, now that we're all friends again, why don't we make a foursome?
Ned Flanders: All right! This will be fun! Oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there.
Homer Simpson: That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.
Todd Flanders: It is difficult, Mr. Simpson. The best strategy is to play conservatively. Hug the rail. It won't go in, but you set yourself up for an easy deuce.
Todd Flanders: Oh, well, huh, it went in.
Ned Flanders: Good shot, Toddsky!
Homer Simpson: (ASIDE TO BART) Luck.
Bart Simpson: Final score: Bart, forty-one. Homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six...

Ned Flanders: So, my little Bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?
Homer Simpson: Yeah, he's entering and what's more, he's going to win, aren't you, boy?
Bart Simpson: (HALFHEARTEDLY) I guess it's possible.
Ned Flanders: Hey, I like that confidence!... but I hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. My Todd's awfully good.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah! Well I think the fruit of my loins can beat the fruit of your loins any day of the week.
Homer Simpson: Come on, boy.
Bart Simpson: But Dad, I've never won anything in my life.
Homer Simpson: Son, this is the only time I'm ever gonna say this. It is not okay to lose.
(Simpson Home: EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BACKYARD - THE NEXT MORNING)
Marge Simpson: (IRRITATED) You brought food...
Homer Simpson: (TO SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER) Stay, stay. Good dog. Now, keep your head down.
Homer Simpson: No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. (TO BART) Keep your head down. Follow through...
Homer Simpson: Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through.
Bart Simpson: Oh, man.
Homer Simpson: (OUTRAGED) What're you doing? That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. Now, c'mon, give your putter a name.
Bart Simpson: What?
Homer Simpson: Come on, give it a name.
Bart Simpson: (TIMIDLY) Mr. Putter.
Homer Simpson: Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girl's name.
Bart Simpson: Mom.
Homer Simpson: (GRUFFLY) Your putter's name is Charlene!
Bart Simpson: Why?
Homer Simpson: It just is. That's why.
Homer Simpson: Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him.
Bart Simpson: Who's Charlene?
Homer Simpson: (ANGRY) I'll show you who Charlene is! Now start hating!

Homer Simpson: And?
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament.
Homer Simpson: But, Marge, this is our big chance to show up the Flanderses.
Marge Simpson: Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?
Homer Simpson: Because sometimes the only way you can feel good about yourself is by making someone else look bad. (BITTERLY) And I'm tired of making other people feel good about themselves.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS)

(TOP OF MOUNT SPRINGFIELD: ext. top of mount springfield - day)
Lisa Simpson: Bart, I have a riddle for you: What's the sound of one hand clapping?
Bart Simpson: Piece of cake.
Lisa Simpson: No, Bart. It's a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought.
Bart Simpson: No answer? Lisa, listen up.
Lisa Simpson: Let's try another one: If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?
Homer Simpson: I said NOW!
Lisa Simpson: But Bart, how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it?
Bart Simpson: Woooooooo!
Lisa Simpson: It is time.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - day)
Lisa Simpson: The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. All you have to do is hit the ball here.

Homer Simpson: Bart! What're you doing? Get down from there before the neighbors see --
Ned Flanders: Hey, Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt.
Ned Flanders: (CLINGING TO HIS DECENCY) Well, sir, may the best man win.
Homer Simpson: Ah, "may the best man win". The mating call of the loser.
Ned Flanders: Now, just a minute, Simpson. I think my son has a very good chance.
Homer Simpson: Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?
Ned Flanders: Yeah, well, I'm not a betting man.
Ned Flanders: Oh, I'm a chicken, am I?
Homer Simpson: That's right!
Ned Flanders: All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!
Homer Simpson: What, are you afraid to make a real bet?
Ned Flanders: No, I just --
Ned Flanders: (GETTING ANGRY) You know, Simpson, you're starting to annoy me.
Homer Simpson: How about this Henny Penny? If Bart wins tomorrow, you have to mow my lawn.
Ned Flanders: (EVEN ANGRIER) All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!
Homer Simpson: Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress.
Ned Flanders: (SCREAMING) You have yourself a bet, you (BEAT) jackaninny!
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson kitchen - day)
Homer Simpson: Read that back to me, Marge.
Marge Simpson: (READS) "The father of the loser mows the lawn -- "
Ned Flanders: (INTERRUPTS) Eh, eh, just a minute. "Loser" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say "the boy who doesn't win"?
Homer Simpson: Oh man. Fine.
Marge Simpson: (WRITING) "The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress."
Ned Flanders: There you go.
Marge Simpson: Now I suppose you both have to sign this. I hope blood won't be necessary.
Homer Simpson: I'm game if you are, Flanders.
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - minutes later)
Ned Flanders: (SIGHS) Good gravy, what have I done?
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - day)
Homer Simpson: Keep your left arm straight, Bart... rotate your shoulders...
Lisa Simpson: Dad!
Homer Simpson: (GENTLY) Look, son, all I'm asking is that you try.
Bart Simpson: Okay, I'll try.
Homer Simpson: (SCORNFUL) Anybody can try! I want you to win!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - master bedroom - night)
Marge Simpson: Homer?!
Homer Simpson: Marge, give me your honest opinion. (HOLDS UP A DRESS) This? (HOLDS UP THE OTHER ONE) Or this?
(Springfield: ext. Springfield - establishing - dawn)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - bart's bedroom)
Homer Simpson: Good morning, son! Oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!
Lisa Simpson: Dad!
Homer Simpson: See you downstairs, boy.
Homer Simpson: Heh heh... that crazy Marmaduke...
Lisa Simpson: Eighth hole.
Bart Simpson: (AUTOMATICALLY) Aim for the Octopus' third tentacle.
Lisa Simpson: Twelfth hole.
Bart Simpson: Bank it off the pink tombstone.
Lisa Simpson: Nirvana.
Bart Simpson: A state of bliss attained through the extinction of the self.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Bart. A lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, Bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates. Steak will make him logy.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh, well, what won't make him logy?
Lisa Simpson: Oatmeal.
Homer Simpson: Oatmeal?
Lisa Simpson: Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby.
Homer Simpson: News flash, Lisa! Bart is not a horse. Eat your steak, boy.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - afternoon)
Bart Simpson: Mom, do I have to?
British Commentator: Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the finale of what has already been a stirring afternoon of miniature golf. The cream has risen, the wheat has bid farewell to the chaff, and now we approach the championship match with but two warriors remaining: The heretofore unknown Bart Simpson, and Todd Flanders, one of the most skilled ten-year-olds to ever take back the blade.
Lisa Simpson: Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, I'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. But here goes. I believe in you.
Bart Simpson: Thanks, man!
Homer Simpson: Hey, Flanders, it's no use praying. I already did the same thing, and we can't both win.
Ned Flanders: (THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH) Actually, Simpson, we were praying that no one gets hurt.
Homer Simpson: Oh... Well, Flan-ders, it doesn't matter. This time tomorrow, you'll be wearing high heels.
Ned Flanders: No, you will.
Homer Simpson: 'Fraid not.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so.
Homer Simpson: 'Fraid not.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so.
Homer Simpson: (SMUGLY) 'Fraid not infinity.
Ned Flanders: 'Fraid so infinity plus one.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
(MINIATURE GOLF: ext. miniature golf - first hole - continuous)
British Commentator: Young Flanders has the honor and will tee off first.
British Commentator: It's got a chance... (BALL GOES IN) Yes, sir!
Bart Simpson: (DESPAIRINGLY) Oh, man...
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in...
British Commentator: And the battle is well and truly joined!
Homer Simpson: Woo-hoo-hoo! (TO FLANDERS)
Ned Flanders: (TO TODD) Mercy is for the weak, Todd.
(MINIATURE GOLF COURSE: ext. miniature golf course - hole 18 - late afternoon)
British Commentator: If one were to look up "courage" in the Oxford English Dictionary, one might very well come upon a photo of these two gladiators. They approach the final hole in the shadow of the great emancipator, deadlocked at eight strokes on the happy side of par. Soon, one man will emerge triumphant. He will drink naught but champagne, while his opponent tastes bitter defeat in this oft cruel game.
Ned Flanders: It's okay, son. You can recover.
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, PLEADING) Come on, Bart. Remember what Vince Lombardi said: "If you lose, you're out of the family."
Marge Simpson: Homer!
Homer Simpson: Ow.
British Commentator: Neither man showing his best form... This sort of pressure can unhinge even the steeliest of competitors.
Bart Simpson: This is pretty tense, isn't it, Todd?
Todd Flanders: Yeah, my knees are shaking, I've got butterflies in my stomach... but I guess this builds character.
Bart Simpson: Who wants to build character. Let's quit.
Todd Flanders: Okay.
Todd Flanders: We decided we're equally good.
Bart Simpson: We want to call it a draw, man.
British Commentator: (ANNOUNCING) Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw!
British Commentator: (TEARFULLY) You will forgive an old Brit for crying, but this is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since Mountbatten gave India back to the Punjabs.
Bart Simpson: Put her there, man!
Todd Flanders: Yeah, all right!
Ned Flanders: Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. (CHUCKLES) Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. (EXTENDING HIS HAND) Put 'er there, pal.
Homer Simpson: Ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!
Ned Flanders: What are you talking about? Neither boy lost.
Homer Simpson: I got it right here in writing.
Homer Simpson: (READING) "The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress."
Ned Flanders: (DISBELIEVING) But... neither, I mean we're both... I mean, you have to do it too.
Homer Simpson: It's a small price to pay to see you humiliate yourself.
(SIMPSON AND FLANDERS HOUSES: ext. simpson and flanders houses - day)
Marge Simpson: (MOANING) Oh, my best dress.
Lisa Simpson: Why do I get the feeling that someday I'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
Homer Simpson: Listen to 'em laughing... This is so humiliating... I'm never gonna live this down... Damn Flanders...
Homer Simpson: Halftime, Marge, halftime.
Patty Bouvier: Ding-dong!
Ned Flanders: (LAUGHING) Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Oh my God! He's enjoying it!
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: (MUFFLED) Bart, cut it out!
Homer Simpson: Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!
Bart Simpson: She took my glue!
Lisa Simpson: It's not yours, Bart! This is family glue!
Homer Simpson: Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this isn't about glue. It's about territoriality. He only wants the glue because I'm using it.
Bart Simpson: Oh yeah? Prove it!
Lisa Simpson: Here.
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, I don't want your stupid glue.
Marty: (FROM TV) Uh-oh. Here comes our friend, Bullwinkle J. Moose...
Homer Simpson: Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
Bill: (FROM TV; RE: ANTLER) Uh-oh... it looks like ol' Bullwinkle's kinda got a taste of his own medicine!
Marty: (FROM TV) (LAUGHING) He certainly did, Bill!
Bill: (FROM TV; TO SELF) Wait, what did that mean? Did what I say make sense?
Marty: (FROM TV) Well... no... not really, Bill!
Bill: (FROM TV; CHUCKLES) Boy, now I know how the Pilgrims felt.
Marty: (FROM TV) What're you talking about, Bill?
Bart Simpson: Who the hell is that?
Homer Simpson: Bullwinkle.
Bart Simpson: Who? (BEAT) Wait a minute, who's that?
Homer Simpson: Underdog! Don't you know anything?
Bart Simpson: Well, I know it wouldn't hurt 'em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years.
Homer Simpson: Son, this is a tradition. If you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce.
Lisa Simpson: Maggie, I'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family!
Selma Bouvier: Here comes the cavalry!
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Marge Simpson: Homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters.

Maggie Simpson: (SUCKS PACIFIER)
Lisa Simpson: As one of the Simpson women, would you like to contribute something to it?
Lisa Simpson: (HUGS MAGGIE) Oh, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Honey, please. You're in the way.
Bart Simpson: Can't I help you, Mom?
Marge Simpson: Well, okay. Let's see... Can you do the cranberry sauce?
Bart Simpson: Yeah! Where is it?
Marge Simpson: The can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.
Bart Simpson: Here?
Marge Simpson: (DIRECTING HIM) No, no, no, the other shelf.
Bart Simpson: Got it. Now what?
Marge Simpson: Open the can.
Bart Simpson: No problemo. Where's the can opener?
Marge Simpson: It's in the second drawer from the right.
Marge Simpson: No, no, no, no, the other one.
Bart Simpson: Oh, I got ya.

Marge Simpson: Here you go.

Marge Simpson: Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. Bart. Bart?

Marge Simpson: Homer, shouldn't you go pick up Grampa?
Bart Simpson: Yeah.

Selma Bouvier: Mmm-hmmm, and my trout almondine.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR; DEADLY TONE) You knew that I was cooking a turkey.
Patty Bouvier: Which is fine!
Selma Bouvier: More power to ya!
Patty Bouvier: It's just that some people find your turkey a little dry.
Selma Bouvier: Mmm-hmm, and if they want an option... they'll have it.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: Hi, Patty. (KISS) Hi, Selma. (KISS)
Homer Simpson: Good to see ya. (BEAT) Well, gotta pick up my old man! 'Bye!

Announcer: (FROM TV) And the Silverdome, now ablaze with flashbulbs, as "Hurray for Everything" leaves the field! Of course, a stadium's much too big for flash pictures to work, but nobody seems to care!

Patty Bouvier: I always said she was gifted. Definitely from our side of the family. Right, Mom?
Jacqueline Bouvier: (WHISPERING) Leave me alone.
Selma Bouvier: How long did that take you, honey?
Lisa Simpson: I couldn't tell you how many hours. It was a labor of love. It's my homage to some American heroes who may not have fought in any wars, but who nevertheless...
Bart Simpson: Da da daah da da dah daaahhh...
Homer Simpson: Speaking of heroes, here's mine... Tom Turkey!
Bart Simpson: Yikes! What is that?
Lisa Simpson: It's the centerpiece, Bart!
Bart Simpson: Well, it's taking up valuable real estate.
Lisa Simpson: Hey, Bart, stop it!
Bart Simpson: Move it or lose it, toots!
Lisa Simpson: Mom!

Bart Simpson: Okay. I'll take some white meat and stuffing to go... and, send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes.
Marge Simpson: Yes, you do! I hope you're happy, Bart! You've RUINED THANKSGIVING!
Bart Simpson: (FUMING) I didn't ruin Thanksgiving! She did... Buncha jerks... I always get blamed for everything...
Homer Simpson: ...And, Lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. Anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. You saw what happened. Oh, Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?

Lisa Simpson: Mom, I poured my heart into that centerpiece! Things like that always happen in this family!
Marge Simpson: I've noticed that, too. Well, when you feel like coming down, we'll be there.

(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern - continuous)

Bart Simpson: Leave me alone!
Lisa Simpson: (STRIDENT) Just look!
Bart Simpson: Okay... okay.

(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's tavern - day)
Homer Simpson: Rasputin's got the reach, but on the other hand, the Professor's got his patented coma lock. If you ask me, this is gonna be one hell of a match.

I will deaf defy both nature and gravity by leapin' over this tank of water...filled with man-eating great white sharks, deadly electric eels, ravenous piranhas, bone-crushing alligators, and perhaps most frightening of all, the king of the jungle, one ferocious lion.
MURDOCK: (CHUCKLES) I almost forgot. To add a real element of danger, one drop of human blood.
MURDOCK: On the chance that I don't survive, let me just say, seat belts save lives so buckle up.

(HOSPITAL WARD: Int. hospital ward - day)
Dr. Julius Hibbert: This little boy broke his leg trying to fly like Superman.

Dr. Julius Hibbert: I won't even subject you to the horrors of our Three Stooges ward.
Marge Simpson: Gee, I never realized TV was such a dangerous influence.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, as tragic as all this is, it's a small price to pay for countless hours of top-notch entertainment.
Homer Simpson: Amen! (TURNS TO BART) Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?
Bart Simpson: (SINCERE) He certainly has, Dad. I learned a real lesson here today. Thank you. Dr. Hibbert.

(Springfield Gorge: Ext. Springfield GORGE - continuous)
SMYTHE: Hello, children, and welcome to Springfield Gorge.
Bart Simpson: (TO THE GORGE) Wow!!

Bart Simpson: It's an honor, Lance. How you feeling?
MURDOCK: Ow! Doc, I heard a snap.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmm. I'm afraid the bone's broken. Well, that's all of them.
MURDOCK: Don't worry, partner. I've broken that thumb dozens of times. Hey, I bet you'd like an autograph. Nurse.
MURDOCK: (WITH PEN IN MOUTH) Who should I make this out to?
Bart Simpson: Just Bart will be fine, sir.
MURDOCK: (WITH PEN IN MOUTH) To Bart: Thanks for visiting me at Springfield General Hospital. Your visit was a ray of sunshine on an otherwise cloudy day. Your pal, Captain Lance Murdock.

MURDOCK: You're welcome. (TO NURSE) Take this thing out of my mouth now.
Lisa Simpson: Mr. Murdock, my brother is thinking about jumping Springfield Gorge on a skateboard.
MURDOCK: (TO NURSE AND DOCTOR) Could you leave me with the young'uns, please?
Bart Simpson: What's the matter?
Homer Simpson: You didn't mean that. Bart, this isn't one of those phoney-baloney promises I don't expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it.
Bart Simpson: Why?
(SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY: ext. side of the highway)
MURDOCK: Now let me start by saying... good for you, son. It's always good to see young people taking an interest in danger. Now, a lot of people are gonna be telling you you're crazy, and maybe they're right. But the fact of the matter is: bones heal, chicks dig scars, and the United States of America has the best doctor to daredevil ratio in the world.
Lisa Simpson: But Captain Murdock!
Bart Simpson: Thanks, Lance.
MURDOCK: You're welcome, little pardner. On your way out, tell the nurse I'm ready for my sponge bath. (WINKS AT BART) Another fringe benefit. Nurse.
(Simpson Kitchen: int. simpson KItchen - Morning)
Homer Simpson: Springfield Gorge? I thought we settled this daredevil junk.
Bart Simpson: (TO LISA) Squealer.
Lisa Simpson: I'm sorry, Bart. But if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention I'd receive, I'd miss you.
Bart Simpson: Bart, I forbid you to jump over that gorge.
Bart Simpson: You can't.
Homer Simpson: I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, I've done it. I'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all.
Bart Simpson: Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge.
Homer Simpson: He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead.
Marge Simpson: Homer, you're his father. You've got to try and reason with him.
Homer Simpson: Oh, that never works. He's a goner.
Marge Simpson: (EXASPERATED) Oh, come on, Homer. A heart to heart talk with your son, you've got to try.

Homer Simpson: BART!
Bart Simpson: Hey, what gives?
Homer Simpson: Boy, I've tried ordering you, I've tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself.
Bart Simpson: What? Why?
Homer Simpson: Because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
Bart Simpson: (WORRIED) But, Dad, you'll never make it.
Homer Simpson: Don't you think I know that?
Homer Simpson: Goodbye, son.
Bart Simpson: Wait, dad. Don't do it. I won't jump anymore, I promise.
Homer Simpson: Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.

Krusty the Clown: Hi, Kent! (KRUSTY LAUGH)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Hiya.
Bart Simpson: Me and the guys went fishing. Almost caught a catfish this big. (STRETCHES ARMS WIDE)
Roger Meyers, Jr.: There's nothing wrong with it.
Marge Simpson: (UNCOMFORTABLE, EYEING CAMERA) Excuse me. Excuse me. He was addressing me.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: I know. There's nothing wrong with it.
Marge Simpson: Excuse me. There is! I think that it's a bad influence on children.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Oh, give me a break! I think that is a bunch of baloney. And here's why. In preparing for this debate, I did a little research and I discovered a startling thing. There was violence in the past, long before cartoons were invented.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: Yeah, and there was something called the Crusades, for instance. Tremendous violence! Many people killed! The darn thing went on for thirty years.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: That's right, Kent. (TO MARGE) So much for your viewpoint.
Marge Simpson: (SNORTS)
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Ah, well, Kent... to me, the high jinks - of a few comic characters absolutely pale in comparison with the crippling emotional problems a psychiatrist runs into every day. I'm… I'm referring here to women who love too much, fear of winning, sexaholism... stuff like that.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: No, not at all. In fact, one of my guilty little pleasures is to snuggle up with a big bucket of buttered popcorn, dim the lights, turn on Itchy & Scratchy, and laugh myself silly. And what the hell is wrong with that?
Krusty the Clown: (KRUSTY LAUGH) Hi kids!!! (KRUSTY LAUGHS AGAIN)
Krusty the Clown: (APOLOGETICALLY) Oh. I'm sorry, Kent. It's just that when the camera gets on me... (NOTICES CAMERA)... HEY HEY!!! (KRUSTY LAUGH)
Krusty the Clown: Oh.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh.
Marge Simpson: Yes. I'd like to ask all the parents in Springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel. Thank you.

(I & S INTERNATIONAL: int. i & S INTERNATIONAL - roger myers' office)
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Is this Marge Simpson?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: The Marge Simpson who fixed it so cartoons can't be violent anymore?
Marge Simpson: (THROUGH PHONE) Yes?
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) This is Myers. I'm here with the writers. Listen, you're so smart, how do we end this picture?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well... what's the problem you're having?
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Okay, here it is. Itchy just stole Scratchy's ice cream cone...
Animator: (INTERRUPTING) Make it a pie. Pies are easier to draw.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) Okay, a pie. Anyway, Scratchy is understandably upset.
Marge Simpson: Huh huh.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: So we figured he could - you know - just grab Itchy and toss him in a bucket of acid.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh dear!
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (INTO PHONE) But then we remembered that this might be interpreted as violence which is morally wrong now, thanks to you. So what's your big idea? How do we end this?
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Well... let's see... Oh! couldn't Itchy share his pie with Scratchy? Then they would both have pie.
Roger Meyers, Jr.: (THOUGHTFULLY LOOKING AT THE STORYBOARD) It's different, I'll give you that.

Bart Simpson: Borrowed?
Announcer: It's an asphalt spreader! It's sixty- seven tools in one! How much would you pay for a machine that can do all this?
Homer Simpson: One thousand dollars.

Scratchy: Lemonade?
Itchy: Please!
Scratchy: I made it just for you.
Itchy: You are my best friend.
Lisa Simpson: Itchy and Scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
Marge Simpson: I think it conveys a very nice message of sharing.
Bart Simpson: I think it sucks.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM) ... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie.
Itchy: Mmmm, this really hits the spot.
Scratchy: Doesn't it though?
Itchy: You really make good lemonade, Scratchy.
Scratchy: Oh, oh, oh. Thank you, Itchy.
Krusty the Clown: Wasn't that funny, boys and girls? (FRUSTRATED) (A LITTLE TOUGH) Well? Wasn't it?
Marge Simpson: Aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?

Lisa Simpson: And Janey and I went bird watching. We saw a grackle.
Marge Simpson: That's nice dear.
Bart Simpson: Come on, Lis. Let's go finish our soapbox racers.
Lisa Simpson: Okay. May we please be excused?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: (AWE) Wow. What great kids. This is the golden age, Marge. And the parents of Springfield owe it all to you.

Marge Simpson: (SLEEPILY) What in the world?
Helen Lovejoy: Get dressed, Marge. You've got to lead our protest against this abomination!
Marge Simpson: (MYSTIFIED) Hmmm, but that's Michelangelo's David. It's a masterpiece!
Helen Lovejoy: (CORRECTING HER) It's filth. It graphically portrays parts of the human body which - practical as they may be... are evil!
Marge Simpson: But I like that statue.

Homer Simpson: Really? Great!
Marge Simpson: I'm not. I think everyone in Springfield should see it.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Hmmm... yes and no.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Hold it, hold it, hold it... how can you be for one form of freedom of expression, like (INDICATES STATUE) our big naked friend over there, and be against another form, like Itchy and Scratchy?
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Kent Brockman: Good question.
Marge Simpson: (THINKS) Well... I guess I can't, which is a shame because I really hate those cartoons.
Dr. Marvin Monroe: Oh yeah, well what do you have to say to all those Marge Simpson wannabes out there who wish to suppress David's doodle.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS) Um, I don't know. I guess one person can make a difference, but most of the time, they probably shouldn't.

Homer Simpson: Oh. What's wrong, Marge?
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homie. Here the kids have a chance to see a great work of art and instead they're home watching a cat and mouse disembowel each other.
Homer Simpson: Hey, don't worry Marge, pretty soon every boy and girl in Springfield Elementary School is gonna come and see this thing.

Lionel Hutz: It turns into a sponge when you put it in water.
Homer Simpson: Ooo, classy.
Lionel Hutz: I'd like to talk to you about bringing legal action against the fiend who did this to your boy.
Scratchy: (EVEN MORE AGONIZED SHRIEK)
Homer Simpson: Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious.
Lionel Hutz: (SCOFFING) Doctors! Doctors are idiots! There's no telling what kind of permanent injuries he might have. You might have to wait on him hand and foot (POKING HOMER IN THE CHEST AT EACH WORD) for the rest of his natural life!
Lionel Hutz: That's the downside. Now here's the good part. You can ching-ching-ching cash in on this tragedy.
Homer Simpson: (MASSAGING HIS CHEST) Wow...
Lisa Simpson: Excuse me, Mr. Hutz. Are you a shyster?
Lionel Hutz: How does a nice little girl like you know a big word like that?
Marge Simpson: Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this.
Lionel Hutz: You're right, you're right. When you feel up to it, come over to my office and we'll talk about it.
Lionel Hutz: (FADING) Lionel Hutz, Attorney-At-Law. What's that, a broken neck? Great!
Lisa Simpson: Hello, Dr. Hibbert.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hello, Lisa. (TO BART) Well, we've got a nasty bump on our head, haven't we?
Bart Simpson: Ow! Quit it!
Dr. Julius Hibbert: And a little tiny broken toe. (WRIGGLES BART'S BROKEN TOE)

Homer Simpson: (STUNNED) A hundred bucks?
Homer Simpson: W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone...
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, so extortion is the name of your little game, is it Simpson? (GRABBING CHECK) Very well. Then you get nothing. I have the finest lawyers in Springfield, Simpson. (THE LAWYERS NOD SMUGLY) Tangle with me and I'll crush you like a paper cup.

Homer Simpson: (RESISTING) Fifty percent?
Lionel Hutz: You'll be getting more than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson. You'll also be getting this exquisite faux pearl necklace -- a $99 value -- as our gift to you.
Homer Simpson: (LOOKING AT NECKLACE) Well... I dunno... You and I might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.

Bart Simpson: Will I ever play baseball again?
Homer Simpson: (BREAKING DOWN AGAIN) No!
Bart Simpson: But I played baseball this morning!
Marge Simpson: That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Dr. Hibbert from (SING-SONG) Johns Hopkins Medical School?
Lionel Hutz: With all due respect, Mrs. Simpson, you are not a doctor, the boy's not a doctor, I'm not a doctor. The only person in this room who even comes close is this man.

C. Montgomery Burns: What about the headlines?
Waylon Smithers: The press might be critical of you for firing the crippled boy's father so soon after the accident.
Lionel Hutz: Thank you, your honor. (HE APPROACHES BART) Now, Bart, I want you to tell the jury, in your own words, exactly what happened on the day of the accident.
Homer Simpson: Just give me a ticket.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well... all right, then. I don't want to seem like an ogre. (VERY SINISTER) I'll bide my time. Let him twist in the wind... slowly... slowly. And then... when the papers have found their new "flavor of the month", he'll find out this cat has claws!

Bart Simpson: (INTIMIDATED) I am in constant pain.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, may I please make an observation?
Homer Simpson: Oh, what? What is it?
Lisa Simpson: I think this is all a charade to make Bart look more injured than he really is.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe Lisa does have a point. I don't mind you boys doing this in the living room, but in court doesn't Bart have to tell the truth?
Lionel Hutz: Yeah, but what is truth -- if you follow me. Now, Bart, can you roll your eyes back in your head like this?

Judge Snyder: Uh-huh. Well, you wouldn't lie to the United States, would you, Bart?

Homer Simpson: Don't mind if I do.
C. Montgomery Burns: Bottoms up Simpson, there's plenty more where that came from.
Homer Simpson: Mr. Burns, are you trying to get me drunk?
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes. Now then, Homer, old chum, I'm sure you'll agree with me that this trial is an affront to our collective dignity. What do you say, we settle this man to man?
Homer Simpson: You mean duke it out?
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLES) Oh, no, I mean I'm prepared to offer you a most generous cash settlement.
C. Montgomery Burns: A princely sum...
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all.
Homer Simpson: (LOUD) Five hundred thousand dollars!
Marge Simpson: Goodness!
C. Montgomery Burns: (WITH FINGER TO LIPS) Up-up-up-up. Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over with the missus, soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be. Smithers, let's go powder my nose.
Homer Simpson: Well, Marge, what do you think?
Marge Simpson: (HALFHEARTED) I don't know. Maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us.
C. Montgomery Burns: (SOTTO) The fish is in the pan.
Marge Simpson: What do you think, Homer?
Homer Simpson: I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks (SCREAMING) I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, I feel faint..
Homer Simpson: (DERISIVE) "Five hundred thousand dollars." I spit on his five hundred thousand dollars.
Marge Simpson: Homer, what's happened to you? All this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --
C. Montgomery Burns: Phony doctors? Hel-lo.
Marge Simpson: Do you know what I'd settle for if it was up to me? Bart's medical bills and an apology!
Smitty: You better be dyin'!
C. Montgomery Burns: And you won't even get that.
C. Montgomery Burns: Sorry, offer's expired. I guess we'll just have to let the jury decide, twelve good men and true. Good day. Smithers, release the hounds.
(Courtroom: int. courtroom - day)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Your honor, I would like to call to the stand Mrs. Homer J. Simpson.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS UNCOMFORTABLY)
Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS; THEN) Yes, I do.
Lionel Hutz: (TO HOMER) She sounded like she was taking that awful seriously.
Homer Simpson: (WHINING) Oh, the truth!
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Mrs. Simpson, does the name Julius Hibbert mean anything to you?
Marge Simpson: Yes, he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day I became a mother. He's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: (FEIGNED SURPRISE) But, wait a minute! I'm confused! This court heard "expert" testimony from one Dr. Nick Riviera. What is your opinion of him?
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS UNCOMFORTABLY)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Mrs. Simpson...
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, but my mother always said, "If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."
Homer Simpson: (TO HUTZ) Will that hold up in court?
Lionel Hutz: No, I've tried it before.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: (FORCEFULLY) Mrs. Simpson, what is your opinion of Dr. Riviera? And let me remind you that you're under oath.
Marge Simpson: Well, to be honest, he seemed a lot more concerned about wrapping Bart in bandages than in making him feel better. And he mispronounced words that even I know, like abdomen. And his office was dirty. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure he's even a doctor.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Blue-Haired Lawyer: And Mrs. Simpson, could you describe for us in your own words Bart's (MAKES AIR QUOTES WITH FINGERS) "intense mental anguish and suffering"?
Marge Simpson: Well, I don't know how intense it was...
BURNS LAWYER: Huh uh.
Marge Simpson: ...but, well, I guess he did miss three days of school --
BURNS LAWYER: Oh, three days.
Marge Simpson: ...although he doesn't really like school all that much,
Marge Simpson: ...so I guess that may not count as anguish.
BURNS LAWYER: No, it doesn't.
Marge Simpson: It was a little hard on me having him around the house
BURNS LAWYER: Yes...
Marge Simpson: ...all that time.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships?
Marge Simpson: Well, we pay Bart five dollars a week to take out the trash...
BURNS LAWYER: Huh uh.
Marge Simpson: I suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Five dollars?
Marge Simpson: Um-hmm.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: But your lawyer -- assuming he is a lawyer -- is asking for a million? (TO JURY) Well, we can't blame them for trying can we. Thank you very much, Mrs. Simpson.
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING) Oh, Marge.
(GLASS BOOTH: INT. GLASS BOOTH)
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm going to write a figure on this piece of paper. It's not quite as large as the last one, but I think you'll find it fair.
Lionel Hutz: I think we should take it.
Homer Simpson: (SHUDDERS)
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - dining room)
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.
Marge Simpson: Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) Yeah, a million dollars worth you treacherous snake woman. (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Some string beans?
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) No I don't want any string beans either you two-timing, back-stabbing. Uh oh I better answer. (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Marge Simpson: Some celery with cream cheese on it?
Homer Simpson: (UNINTELLIGIBLE MURMUR) (FLATLY) No, thank you.
Bart Simpson: You know what would've really been cool? If we got that million bucks.
Marge Simpson: Bart, please.
Bart Simpson: What? We could have bought tons of great stuff, Mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if I'm wrong.
Homer Simpson: Marge, dear. Would it be all right if I went over to Moe's for a drink?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) I don't know if I'll ever come back here. (FLATLY) Goodnight.
Marge Simpson: (SHRIEK)
Marge Simpson: (THINKING) My woman's intuition is telling me something... I wonder what... Oh my god.
(Moe's Tavern: INT. MOE'S TAVERN)
Homer Simpson: Well, that's it. I guess this is the class I'm gonna die in.
Moe Szyslak: Eh, you're better off. Rich people aren't happy. From the day they're born, to the day they die, they think they're happy but, trust me... they ain't.
Homer Simpson: (THINKING) Moe, I wish he'd shut up.
Larry: Look, a chick!
Moe Szyslak: And it's not even Ladies Night.
Homer Simpson: Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It's just my wife.
Marge Simpson: (WITH THE ABOVE) My name is Marge. (TO HOMER)
Marge Simpson: Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.
Homer Simpson: Oh, Marge...
Marge Simpson: We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--
Homer Simpson: (WITH TROUBLE) No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance.
Marge Simpson: What are you saying, Homer?
Homer Simpson: I'm saying... (THINKING) She's been your wife for ten years, you've had three children together, it's time to be honest with her. (TO MARGE) I'm not sure I love you anymore.
Marge Simpson: (GASPS)
Homer Simpson: But don't worry. I'll never let on. I'll still do all the bed stuff. Maybe it won't be so bad.
Marge Simpson: Oh my Lord. Well, I don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: Homer, look at me.
Homer Simpson: Alright, alright, look at her if it'll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her.
Homer Simpson: Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever.
Marge Simpson: I love you too!
Senator Mendoza: McBain!!
Homer Simpson: Sorry to scare you like that, babe.
Moe Szyslak: Okay, everybody! For the next fifteen minutes, one third off on every pitcher... one per customer... domestic beer only... hey, no sharing!
(Simpson Kitchen: INT. SIMPSON KITCHEN - DINNERTIME)
Homer Simpson: Is it done yet? Is it done yet?
Marge Simpson: Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Isn't there anything faster than a microwave? (COUNTING DOWN WITH TIMER) Four, three, two, one, ping!
Homer Simpson: We have meatloaf!
Marge Simpson: (CALLS OUT) Get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!
Homer Simpson: (TEMPTINGLY) Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Thursday -- meatloaf night. As it was, is now, and ever shall be.
Homer Simpson: What are you getting at?
Lisa Simpson: Well, you're always trying to teach me to be opened-minded, try new things, live life to the...
Homer Simpson: What are you talking about? Nobody's trying to teach you that.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe Lisa's right. Tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner.
Homer Simpson: Tomorrow night!? Friday!? Pork chop night!? Marge, we haven't missed pork chop night since the great pig scare in '87.
Lisa Simpson: (SIGHS) Friday night, pork chops. From cradle to grave... etched in stone in God's library somewhere...
Homer Simpson: Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?
Lisa Simpson: Anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken.
Homer Simpson: Fine. We'll go to Mars.
Marge Simpson: There's that new sushi restaurant on Elm Street.
Bart Simpson: Sushi? Hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on the playground... but, isn't that raw fish?
Lisa Simpson: As usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point entirely. Sushi is considered quite a delicacy.
Marge Simpson: Please, Homer. Can't we try it?
Homer Simpson: No!
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad. This argument humiliates us both.
Homer Simpson: If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?
Lisa Simpson: Nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time.
Homer Simpson: Oh, try me.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Please, Dad.
Homer Simpson: No!

Marge Simpson: What would you recommend for a family that's not sure they should be here?
Akira: The sushi sampler has a little bit of everything. It is very non-threatening.
Marge Simpson: I'll have one of those.
Lisa Simpson: Make it two.
Bart Simpson: Akira, my good man, I'd like two sharks, an octopus and an eel.
Akira: Very good.
Bart Simpson: (TO AKIRA) Do you have any giant squid? The kind that drags men to their deaths?
Akira: Not today. (TO HOMER) And sir?
Homer Simpson: It's so hard to choose. It all looks so terrible. Just bring me (POINTING AT MENU) one of these, and one of these, and one of those.
(The Happy Sumo: Int. the happy sumo - kitchen)
Toshiro: What do you think, Master?
Master: No, no, no. Toshiro, the squid looks like it's been hacked by a blind woodsman. Hang your head in shame.
Homer Simpson: Good thing I'm open-minded. (PINCHES HIS NOSE)
Homer Simpson: Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.
Homer Simpson: I'll try this little pink one, here. Hmmm, very good. Another one.
Homer Simpson: Oh boy, this fish is dee-lish!
Richie Sakai: Hi. My name is Richie Sakai. I'm an anesthesiologist.
Richie Sakai: And I'd like to dedi-cate this next song to my wife, Patti. (SINGS) "I WAS BORN IN THE WAGON OF A TRAVELLING SHOW / MAMA USED TO DANCE FOR THE MONEY THEY'D THROW / PAPA WOULD DO WHATEVER HE COULD..."
Homer Simpson: ... oh, oh, and two of these things.
Akira: Two uni.
Homer Simpson: And, Oh, Oh, I don't believe I've tried the flying fish roe...
Akira: I recommend it with a raw quail egg on top.
Homer Simpson: You're the doctor!
Bart Simpson: (SINGING IN LOW VOICE) "WHO'S THE BLACK PRIVATE DICK THAT'S THE SEX MACHINE TO ALL THE CHICKS?"
Lisa Simpson: "Shaft."
Bart Simpson: "You're damn right. WHO'S THE CAT THAT WON'T COP OUT / WHEN THERE'S DANGER ALL ABOUT?"
Lisa Simpson: "Shaft."
Bart Simpson: "Right on."
Homer Simpson: There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!
Akira: It is blowfish, sir. But I should warn you that one...
Homer Simpson: Come on, pal! Fugu me!
Bart Simpson: "THEY SAY THIS CAT SHAFT IS A BAD MOTHER..."
Lisa Simpson: "Shut your mouth!"
Bart Simpson: "But I'm talkin' about Shaft."
Lisa Simpson: "I can dig it!"
Bart Simpson: "HE'S A COMPLICATED MAN BUT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIM BUT HIS WOMAN."
Lisa Simpson: "John Shaft."
Master: Oh, she's here. Cover for me.
Akira: One fugu.
Toshiro: Not fugu! If it is cut improperly it's... it's...
Akira: (DISMISSING) Yes, yes, it is poisonous, potentially fatal, but if sliced properly, it can be quite tasty.
Toshiro: (TO HIMSELF) I must get the Master.
Master: Oh, Miss Krabappel, your hair smells so clean.
Toshiro: Master, you are needed in the kitchen.
Master: I said cover for me, damn it!
Toshiro: But Master, we need your skilled hands.
Master: My skilled hands are busy. You do it!
Toshiro: Poison, poison, tasty fish.
Toshiro: (TO HIMSELF) Concentrate. Concentrate...
Homer Simpson: (YELLING) I want fugu!
Homer Simpson: Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.
Homer Simpson: Beautiful language, isn't it, Marge?
Toshiro: For God's sake, don't eat another bite!
Homer Simpson: Oh, I couldn't possibly.
Toshiro: Mr. Simpson-san. I shall be blunt. We have reason to believe you have eaten poison.
Homer Simpson: Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!
Toshiro: Oh, no need to panic. There's a map to the hospital on the back of the menu.
(Hospital: ext. hospital - establishing)
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF, MIMICKING) "Try something new, Homer. What'll it hurt you, Homer?" (THEN) I never heard of a poison pork chop.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Hmmm, your wife agreed that I should break this to you.
Homer Simpson: No need, Doc. I can read Marge like a book.
Homer Simpson: (BRIGHTLY) Oooh! It's good news, isn't it?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: No, Mr. Simpson. If in fact, you've consumed the venom of the blowfish -- and from what the chef has told me, it's quite probable, you have twenty-four hours to live.
Homer Simpson: (UPSET) Twenty-four hours?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, twenty-two. I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Homer Simpson: (BREAKING DOWN) Oh Marge, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Well, if there's one consolation it's that you will feel no pain at all until some time tomorrow evening when your heart suddenly explodes.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Now, a little death anxiety is normal. You can expect to go through five stages. The first is denial.
Homer Simpson: No way! Because I'm not dying.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: The second is anger.
Homer Simpson: (GROWING ANGRY) Why you little --
Dr. Julius Hibbert: And after that comes fear.
Homer Simpson: (FEARFULLY) What's after fear? What's after fear?
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Bargaining.
Homer Simpson: Doc, you gotta get me out of this. I'll make it worth your while.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Finally, acceptance.
Homer Simpson: Well, we all gotta go some time.
Homer Simpson: Told ya. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Mr. Simpson, your progress astounds me. I-I should leave you two alone. Perhaps this pamphlet will be helpful.

(Bedroom: int. bedroom - night)
Homer Simpson: Hello, Marge? Hello? I'm the one who's dying, not you.
Marge Simpson: I'm sorry, Homer. Have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?
Homer Simpson: Nothing. It'll just upset them. I want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS IN AGREEMENT) Well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?
Homer Simpson: Almost.
Homer Simpson: I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I... you know...
Marge Simpson: When we're intimate?
Homer Simpson: (WRITING) Be intimate with Marge.
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Can I just make one suggestion? Can we get up early and watch the sunrise together?

Bart Simpson: (RAPID FIRE PROTEST) Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why don't you go yell at her?
Homer Simpson: Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, "cover for me." Number two, "oh, good idea, boss." Number three, "it was like that when I got here."
Bart Simpson: Hey, this is good stuff.
Homer Simpson: ...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave.

Bald One: My mother. Real mature. I'm sick of your...
Homer Simpson: I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
Bart Simpson: Hey, what gives?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, do something!
Homer Simpson: All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery.
Bart Simpson: Looks like you lost the patient, Doc.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?
Lisa Simpson: (ALARMED) No!
Homer Simpson: How's this?
Lisa Simpson: (SCREAM)
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUSLY) Okay, just everybody remain calm.
Lisa Simpson: (ANGUISHED SCREAM)
Bart Simpson: Hey, everybody! If you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out.
Homer Simpson: Hey, yeah, yeah. I think I can.
Marge Simpson: I think this is sick. They're staring at a dot!
Homer Simpson: She's right! She's right!
Homer Simpson: (BREAKS DOWN, CRYING) Oh, how I miss TV! Dear, God. Just give me one channel!
Marge Simpson: Homer. It's not the end of the world. You know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television.
Bart Simpson: You lie!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Marge Simpson: No, it's true, Bart. We used to shoot pool... and go dancing...
Lisa Simpson: How romantic.
Marge Simpson: And a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this.
Marge Simpson: Whoa--
Bart Simpson: I'm livin' it but I ain't lovin' it.
Lisa Simpson: It's so hard to picture you two then. Hand in hand at the crossroads of life. There are so many questions.
Marge Simpson: Pick one.
Lisa Simpson: Okay. Uh... how did Dad propose to you?
Marge Simpson: Uh... well....

Homer Simpson: (DISMISSIVE SOUND) English! Who needs that? I'm never going to England. Come on, let's go smoke.
Marge Simpson: I'm for equal rights. But do we really need a whole amendment?
Kim: Come on, Marge. Don't you think you deserve to earn just as much as a man who does the same job?
Marge Simpson: Not if I have to do heavy lifting or math.
Kim: Oh Marge. You really ought to read this.

Principal Dondelinger: Well, well, well. If it isn't Homer Simpson and Barney Gumbel. Springfield's answer to Cheech and Chong.
Principal Dondelinger: Allow me, gentlemen. You just bought yourselves three days of detention. You know where and when.
Barney Gumble: (SADLY) Three o'clock. Old building. Room 106.
(Springfield High School: ext. springfield high school - front lawn)
Marge Simpson: ... And in another article, I found out that to hire professionals to do all the jobs of a housewife, who incidentally is not married to a house, would cost forty-eight thousand dollars a year!
Marge Simpson: The first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
Kim: I didn't think it would burn so fast.
Marge Simpson: Hm, I guess it's the tissue paper inside.
Principal Dondelinger: Miss Bouvier, I am surprised!
Principal Dondelinger: You just bought yourself one day of detention. You know where and when.

Homer Simpson: Well, yeah, maybe, but I just met this girl, Marge Bouvier and I want to force her to like me.
MCINTYRE: (CHUCKLES) That's not exactly the type of guidance I give.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS) Oh.
MCINTYRE: Well, I like to think I do something helpful for every student N through Z. The only advice I can give you is, try to share a common interest and spend, spend, spend.
Homer Simpson: Well, what interest does she have that I could make common?
MCINTYRE: Oh, I believe she's very active on the Forensics Team. They meet in the new building. Room two-nineteen.

MCINTYRE: Homer, do you have any plans for after graduation?

Homer Simpson: Wait a minute! That word you keep calling me --
Artie Ziff: Ignoramus?
Homer Simpson: Ignoramus. It means I'm stupid! Doesn't it?

Homer Simpson: Well, a... You see the problem is, you don't know me. I have references. Just ask Coach Flanagan, and ask Mr. Seckofsky and Barney Gumbel.
Marge Simpson: Hmm, I don't know.
Homer Simpson: Look, I'm not asking you to like me, I'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where I can touch your goodies, I'm just asking you to be fair.
Coach Flanagan: Homer Simpson? Oh, yeah. Junior Varsity shot putter. Hmmm, hmmm. I think if he applies himself, trains real hard, hits the weights, he could go another foot.

Marge Simpson: You know, Homer, you're like no one I've ever met before. You're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension.
Homer Simpson: I'll take that as a compliment. So, will you go out with me? (BEAT) Please say oui.
Marge Simpson: Oui.
Homer Simpson: Ohhh! oh, Marge! This'll be the greatest night of your life. I've been saving up for a new engine for my car, but I'm gonna spend it all on us. I'm renting the biggest limo. I'm gonna buy you the biggest corsage. My tux is gonna have the widest lapels, the most ruffles, and the highest platform shoes you ever saw.
Marge Simpson: Maybe I'll wear my hair... up.
Homer Simpson: Wait, wait, wait, Marge. If honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. I'm not really in any French class. This was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better.

Artie Ziff: I can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments. Now the first is from Time Magazine... dated January 8, 1974, "America's Love Affair with The Prom... Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year..."
Marge Simpson: No, Artie, Artie. The best argument is that I've known and respected you for eight years, and I would be delighted to go to the prom with you.

Teacher: Oh hell is a terrible place. Maggots are your sheet, worms your blanket. There's a lake of fire burning with sulfur, you'll be tormented day and night forever and ever. As a matter of fact, if you actually saw Hell, you'd be so frightened, you would die.
Bart Simpson: Oh, Miss Albright.
Teacher: Yes, Bart.
Bart Simpson: Are there pirates in hell?
Martin Prince: (RAISING HAND) So what you're saying is, there's a down side to the afterlife. How does one steer clear of this abode of the damned?
Teacher: By obeying the Ten Commandments.
Teacher: Ten simple rules that are easy to live by.
(Simpson Car: int. simpson car)
Marge Simpson: So, what did you children learn about today?
Bart Simpson: Hell.
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Well, that's what we learned about. I sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell unless I say hell, can I?
Homer Simpson: The lad has a point.
Bart Simpson: Hell, yes.
Marge Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: (SING-SONGY) Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell.
Marge Simpson: Bart, you're no longer in Sunday School. Don't swear.

Bart Simpson: Hey, anybody up for a little so-called pay TV?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, are you sure this isn't stealing?
Homer Simpson: Read the pamphlet, honey.
Homer Simpson: Oh, goody! A program-length advertisements!
Panelist #1: (THRU TV) Wait a minute, Troy. I'm a little confused. Did you say, "cleans and straightens"?
Dr. Nick Riviera: Thank you, Troy. Hi everybody!
Dr. Nick Riviera: Now for if I had a volunteer. Somebody with crooked yellow teeth.
Devil: Come on, Lisa. Watch a little cable with us. (HE CHUCKLES)
Devil: It won't cost you a thing... (LAUGHTER) except your soul!
Marge Simpson: What's gotten into Lisa?
Bart Simpson: Beats the hell out of me.
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Ehhhh!

Lisa Simpson: Mom, what are you doing?
Marge Simpson: What? Whadda ya mean?
Lisa Simpson: Well, don't you remember the Eighth Commandment?
Marge Simpson: Oh, of course. It's thou shalt not... uh... covet... graven images... something about covet...
Lisa Simpson: (THUNDEROUSLY) Thou shalt not steal!
Clerk: Anything else?
Marge Simpson: Yes. I ate two grapes. Please charge me for them.
Clerk: Oh, two grapes? Who cares?
Marge Simpson: Just charge me something, please.
Clerk: Yeah, okay, all right. (INTO MIC) I need a price check on two grapes. Yeah, you heard me, Phil, two measly, stinking grapes.

Blockbuster Announcer: If you didn't catch it in the theater, or rent it, or see it someplace else, we've got it -- on the Blockbuster Channel!
Lisa Simpson: Dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?
Homer Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Oh, great... (TO LISA) All right, what makes you say that?
Lisa Simpson: Well, at Sunday School we learned that stealing is a sin.
Homer Simpson: Well, duh.
Lisa Simpson: But everybody does it! I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak.
Homer Simpson: Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?
Lisa Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
Lisa Simpson: No, I didn't.
Homer Simpson: Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds.
Lisa Simpson: Dad, I think that's pretty spurious.
Homer Simpson: Well, thank you honey.
Blockbuster Announcer: Friday night, live from Las Vegas. The ultimate match-up. The Bout to Knock the Other Guy Out.
Homer Simpson: Whooo!
Blockbuster Announcer: It's Watson-Tatum II. This time, it's for money!

Lenny Leonard: Hey, big fight comin' up.
Carl Carlson: Yeah, you want to come over to my house and listen to round-by-round updates on the radio?
Lenny Leonard: Oh yeah, okay. Oh, then after the fight, we can watch the still photos on the eleven o'clock news.
Carl Carlson: Not too shabby! Whadda you say, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (COYLY) We could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable TV.
Homer Simpson: Pass the pumice, please.
Waylon Smithers: Uh, he's Homer Simpson, sir. One of your drones from sector 7G.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. I'm so keen on seeing Watson vs. Tatum II, I'd even go to an employee's house. Oh, I can picture it now. The screen door rusting off its filthy hinges. Mangy dog staggering about looking vainly for a place to die.
Waylon Smithers: Permission to speak frankly, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Permission granted.
Waylon Smithers: Well, you are quite wealthy sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Thank you, Smithers. Your candor is most refreshing.
Waylon Smithers: No, no, I mean, why don't you pay for the fight yourself?
C. Montgomery Burns: Eh, Smithers, a big title fight is one of those rare occasions that I savor the sights, the sounds; and, (INHALES DEEPLY) ah yes, the smells of other men.
Waylon Smithers: You haven't lost the common touch, sir.
(Moe's Tavern: int. moe's bar - later that day)
Barney Gumble: So, Homer, I hear you got the fight.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, that's right. Eight o'clock, my place. Come one, come all.
Barney Gumble: Hey, Moe, how come you never got cable for the bar?
Moe Szyslak: Well, it was either cable or the mechanical bull.
Moe Szyslak: I made my choice and I stand by it.

Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Ooh! Somebody's having a party.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, Friday night. You want to come over?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Thank you, but this store is open twenty-four hours. It puts great demands on my time.
Homer Simpson: Oh, too bad. It's gonna be a great fight.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh, the fight. Why didn't you say something? I'll get my brother, Sanjay, to cover for me. He deplores violence of all kinds.
(First Church of Springfield: ext. church - establishing)
Lisa Simpson: So, even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that would be stealing?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: No. Well, it is if he puts anything on it. Jelly, for example.
Lisa Simpson: (SOLEMNLY) I see.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: (BEAT) Come on, Lisa, now you're here for a reason. (QUIETLY) Is your father stealing bread?
Lisa Simpson: Maybe. I don't watch him every minute. But what I am sure of is, we're getting cable for free.
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, I'm afraid that is stealing, Lisa, and I think you must do something... hmmm.
Lisa Simpson: Should I have my father arrested?
Rev. Timothy Lovejoy: Well, Lisa, on the surface, that would appear to be an ideal solution to the problem. But remember the Fourth Commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother." Hmmm, Lisa, I would like to see you set an example by not watching the offending technology yourself?
Lisa Simpson: Thank you, Reverend Lovejoy.

Top Hat Announcer: (BREATHLESS FEMALE VOICE) You're watching Top Hat Entertainment. Adult programming all day, every day, except in Florida and Utah. Coming up next, "Stardust Memories."
Bart Simpson: (WIDE-EYED) Aye Carumba!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Bart Simpson: Dad!
Bart Simpson: Oh, here's what I was looking for.
Stock Reporter: Blue chips closed up three and three quarters... Oil service stocks slumped slightly on news of OPEC's continuing stalemate at their meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.
Homer Simpson: Son, you shouldn't watch that other channel. It's only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you won't watch that channel ever again.
Bart Simpson: Okay.
Homer Simpson: Promise me.
Bart Simpson: I promise I will never watch that channel again.
Homer Simpson: Good boy.
Lisa Simpson: Hi, Dad. I think stealing cable is wrong. So I'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. It's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. Thank you for your time.
Homer Simpson: Hey Lisa -- (CHANGING CHANNELS) Racing from Belmont? Horsies!
Lisa Simpson: Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven.
Homer Simpson: There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium.
Marge Simpson: Well, you know, Bart was looking at that racy movie today, and Lisa's losing a little respect for you... Maybe we should think about unhooking the cable.
Homer Simpson: Unhook it?! But I love cable.
Marge Simpson: Well, then maybe you should pay for it.
Homer Simpson: Look, look, Marge. I can't afford it. When I can afford to pay for it, I will. But I can't, so I'm not going to.
Marge Simpson: But Homer, I'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I never put my foot down about anything.
Marge Simpson: No.
Homer Simpson: ...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
Marge Simpson: Oh, Homer.
Homer Simpson: Marge, I'm sorry, I think it's coming down.
Marge Simpson: No, Homer, not over this. No, no.
Homer Simpson: It's coming down. My foot is, that's it, Marge. It's coming down. The cable stays. The foot has spoken.
Marge Simpson: (ANNOYED MURMUR)
Homer Simpson: (YAWNS) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it. Ugh! Soccer. (CLICKS REMOTE) Seen it.
Cable Guy: Hey, Simpson!
Homer Simpson: Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?
Cable Guy: Well, your door wasn't locked in any serious way. I wonder if you'd be interested in this car stereo? A five hundred dollar value, but I'll let you have it for forty bucks.
Homer Simpson: Get out of my house! I don't wanna associate with criminals.
Cable Guy: Well, maybe I'll go see your neighbor.
Homer Simpson: He's not home.
Cable Guy: Even better.
Marge Simpson: Are you sure you want to do this, Homer? It doesn't look friendly.
Homer Simpson: Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.
Bart Simpson: Come one, come all, Top Hat Theatre is on the air. The most beautiful women in the world. Just fifty-cents. I am your host, Bart Simpson. You must be at least eight years old to enter.
Bart Simpson: Well, back to the fight.
Top Hat Announcer: And now, the Top Hat Channel is honored to present, "Broadcast Nudes."
Milhouse Van Houten: Gross!
Martin Prince: Yet strangely compelling.
Milhouse Van Houten: It's a raid!
Homer Simpson: (SPUTTERING) Huh? What the? I know you -- come back here...
Homer Simpson: Bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! Now go to your room.
Bart Simpson: (UNDER HIS BREATH) Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules.
Homer Simpson: Oh great.
Barney Gumble: Here, I brought some imported generic beer.
Marge Simpson: Thank you, Barney. (TO HOMER) How many people are coming, Homer?
Homer Simpson: Just a select circle of my friends.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh Hello, Mrs. Homer. I have brought an assortment of jerkies.
Homer Simpson: Oh, didja swipe those from work?
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (OFFENDED) Certainly not. What has been implied here?
Boxing Announcer #1: Oh, no sir, there is no love lost between these two warriors. In fact, we almost had a scuffle earlier today, at the weigh-in.
Boxing Announcer #2: (TO FIGHTER #1) I understand you have a special motivation going into this bout.
Champ: Yeah, I want to dedicate this fight to my manager Vinnie, who got me here, and then (CHOKING UP) passed away just two weeks ago.
Boxing Announcer #2: Any response to that?
Challenger: Yeth, I would also like to dedicate thIS fight to the memory of his deceased manager.
Champ: You can't do that!
Challenger: I can do whatever I want!
Champ: You dedicate the fight to your manager, man!
Lisa Simpson: I just want to call attention to the fact that I'm not watching this fight. It's my form of non-violent protest.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer, I brought ya...
Homer Simpson: Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs...
Barney Gumble: Hey!
Homer Simpson: All right, will you... Hey, go protest outside will ya, now!.
Moe Szyslak: Hey, Homer. I brought you a mug.
Homer Simpson: (OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC) Oooh, thank you, Moe! I always wanted one of these.
Homer Simpson: Mr. Burns! Bart... quick. Hide the stuff I "borrowed" from work.
Homer Simpson: All right, the stuff I stole from work!
Bart Simpson: Oh, okay.
Homer Simpson: Now, c'mon. Take all this, and this, put it in the closet.
Homer Simpson: (TO LISA) Will you quit staring at me like that!
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hello, Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: We were just in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
Homer Simpson: (STEPPING IN) Ugh, ah, hello, Mr. Burns. Would you like to watch the fight?
C. Montgomery Burns: The fight? Don't mind if I do. Oh, Simpson. Good news -- I brought some munchies. Smithers -- the Cheetos.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
Eddie: Are you Homer Simpson?
Homer Simpson: Yeah.
Lou: Word on the street is that you have an illegal cable hook-up.
Homer Simpson: (SPUTTERING) No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never...
Eddie: Hey, hey, settle down big fella.
Lou: We were, whoa, we were just wondering if we could watch the fight?
Homer Simpson: Oh, sure, sure. Be my guest.
Marge Simpson: Lisa, I brought you some lemonade for your protest.
Lisa Simpson: Thanks, Mom. It doesn't seem to be going very well.
Marge Simpson: Well, don't give up. When you love somebody you have to have faith that in the end they will do the right thing.
Boxing Announcer #2: The Challenger learned how to fight in the notorious projects of Capital City and honed his skills while serving time for aggravated assault and manslaughter in Springfield Prison.
Barney Gumble: All right, a local boy!
Challenger: For five years I was, I was incarcerated, away from my family and the mothers of my children. The conditions were irrevocable.
Homer Simpson: Oh, no.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMING) Marge, Lisa, Maggie...
Referee: Shake hands. Keep it clean.
Homer Simpson: (PANICKED) Come on, boy.
Homer Simpson: Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me, but I wanted you to know I've made a couple of really important decisions. Number one: I'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. And Number Two: I'm not very fond of any of you.
Ranger Ned: (HORRIBLE SCREAMS)
Lisa Simpson: (HAPPILY) Dad, we may have saved your soul.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Yeah, at the worst possible time.

Homer Simpson: The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
Lisa Simpson: We're really proud of you, Dad.
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: (TO BURNS) What a donnybrook game, Mr. Burns.
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, hogwash! Why, I once watched Gentleman Jim Corbett fight an Eskimo fellow bare-knuckled for a hundred and thirteen rounds. Back then, of course, if a fight lasted less than fifty rounds, we demanded our nickel back.
Homer Simpson: Cable clippers, please.
Marge Simpson: Here you go, Homie.
Lisa Simpson: Go for it Dad!
Bart Simpson: Dad, I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls, Atlanta Braves baseball, Joe Franklin...
Homer Simpson: Oops.

Marge Simpson: Homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six servings a week?
Seymour Skinner: (HOPEFUL) See me again tomorrow?
Homer Simpson: Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times.
Marge Simpson: (CROSSING TO THE PHONE) Saturday night? I'm not even sure my sisters will be available.

Seymour Skinner: Then the day after that.
Lisa Simpson: Poor Brandy. Aunt Selma, do you think you'll ever get married?
Selma Bouvier: Oh, I don't know. Why? You know somebody?
Lisa Simpson: No. And, since I'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece, I'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair Prince.
Marge Simpson: Patty! Selma! We're home.
Homer Simpson: I'll tell you one thing, Greasy Joe is sorry he ever saw the likes of me.
Selma Bouvier: Marge, I need to speak with you alone.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! (OFF SNORING) No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law.
Selma Bouvier: I'll get right to the point. I'm getting older, fatter, and uglier. Please, Marge! Help me find a man before it's too late.
Marge Simpson: Well... I'll try.
Marge Simpson: Homer? Do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the Bowler's Hall of Fame in St. Louis, Missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?
Homer Simpson: (FONDLY) Remember? Who could forget?
Marge Simpson: Then you'll also remember that you owe me a favor...
Homer Simpson: (GROANS)
Marge Simpson: ...to be called up whenever and for whatever reason I desire.
Homer Simpson: But that was just an idle promise.
Marge Simpson: Not to me.
Homer Simpson: (GROAN)
Marge Simpson: I want you to find a husband for my sister Selma.
Homer Simpson: Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
Marge Simpson: She's the one who likes Police Academy movies and Hummel figurines and walking through the park on clear autumn days.
Homer Simpson: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. But I thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched.
Marge Simpson: It's Patty who chose the life of celibacy. Selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
Homer Simpson: (WHINING) But Marge...
Marge Simpson: Homer, you will find her a man.
Homer Simpson: All right.
Marge Simpson: And not just any man.

Homer Simpson: (WEARILY) What is it this time?
Seymour Skinner: I'm afraid this time the victims are the innocent blades of grass on Groundskeeper Willie's award-winning play field. If it's all right with you, Bart will repay his debt to society through back-breaking physical labor, re-sodding the field manually, seed by seed.
Homer Simpson: But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?
Seymour Skinner: Only to my job.
Homer Simpson: But if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?
Seymour Skinner: (CHUCKLING) Well, of course. These pants come off at night just like everyone else's. But tell me, why all the questions?
Homer Simpson: (COVERING) Oh, no reason, really. I was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. A payback for all the crummy things Bart has done to your school.
Seymour Skinner: (RUBBING CHIN) Well, a home-cooked meal would be a nice change of pace. I'd be delighted!
Homer Simpson: (TENTING FINGERS) Excellent.

Selma Bouvier: No, you do it.
Patty Bouvier: No, you do it.
Selma Bouvier: No, you do it.

HERB: (GROANS)
Executive #2: And get this, sir. She was carried off to Hades by the King of the Underworld. While there, she ate six pomegranates...
HERB: People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads. They want names like "Mustang" and "Cheetah" -- vicious animal names. The problem with you guys is you've forgotten your roots. (TO EXECUTIVE #2) You, what are your roots?

Homer Simpson: Well, then give me one with lots of pep.
Executive #2: Sorry, our cars don't have pep.

HERB: (TO HOMER) Homer, tell the nice man what country you come from.
Homer Simpson: America.
HERB: Do you hear that, you morons? This is why we're getting killed in the marketplace! Instead of listening to what people want, you're telling 'em what they want. Homer, I need your help.

HERB: Up...up...up. Listen to me, here's what you do. From now on, before you say anything, say to yourself, "If I was ever sure of anything, I'm sure of this." Do you understand?
Homer Simpson: (MEEKLY) Sort of.
HERB: Homer!
Homer Simpson: What?
HERB: Answer me again with self-confidence.
Homer Simpson: (BELLOWING) Sort of!
HERB: Now go get 'em. (SHOUTS)
Homer Simpson: All right you eggheads! I want a place in this car to put my drink!
Head Engineer: Sir, the car has a beverage holder.
Homer Simpson: Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? (MAKING A BIG CIRCLE WITH HANDS) The cup is this big!
Head Engineer: (COWED) Extremely large beverage holder.
Homer Simpson: And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.
Head Engineer: (WRITING) Little... ball.
Homer Simpson: And some things are so snazzy they never go out of style! Like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!
Head Engineer: Bubble domes.

HERB: Y'ello. Uh-huh. (INTO PHONE) Well, you know what, I'm glad you're nervous because that means we're on the right track... Uh huh... Uh huh... Uh huh... All right... all right. Okay, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna hang up, call me back and say the exact opposite of everything you just said. Good bye.
HERB: Bart! Lisa! Come over here!
Lisa Simpson: What is it Unky Herb?
HERB: I want you to hear what the guys down at the plant think of your old man.
HERB: Y'ello.

Homer Simpson: I want a horn here, here and here. You can never find a horn when you're mad. And they should all play "La Cucaracha."
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM)
Homer Simpson: And sometimes, the kids are in the back seat, they're hollering, they're making you nuts. There's got to be something you can do about that.
Head Engineer: Maybe a built-in video game would keep them entertained?
Homer Simpson: You're fired! What is my brother paying you for?
Engineer #3: (TREMBLING) What about a separate sound proof bubble dome for the kids? With optional restraints and nuzzles.
Homer Simpson: Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!

Lisa Simpson: The cat is named Scratchy.
HERB: Uh huh.
Bart Simpson: They hate each other.
Lisa Simpson: And they're not shy about expressing it.
HERB: Oh good, good, good, good.
HERB: To think I've wasted my life in board rooms and stockholders meetings when I could have been watching cartoons. (SADLY) This old fool has wasted his life.

Female Singer: (SINGING) Homer gets...
Homer Simpson: Powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a Nerf ball. Now, at last, I have found it.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the car designed for the Average Man... The Homer!
HERB: (TO HIMSELF) Ew.
HERB: Any questions?
Reporter: What does this monstrosity cost?
HERB: Uh, Jerry, what's the sticker price?
HERB: Eighty-two-thousand dollars! This monstrosity costs eighty-two-thousand dollars? What have I done! I mean the zoo was fun, but I'm ruined.
Lisa Simpson: Bye, Unky Herb.
Marge Simpson: Bye, Herb.
Homer Simpson: Gee, Herb, because of me you lost your business, your home, and all your possessions. I can't help but think that maybe you would have been better off if I'd never come into your life.
HERB: Maybe I would have been better off?! Maybe? Why, you spongehead, of course I'd have been better off! As far as I'm concerned, I have no brother.
Homer Simpson: Ooo.
Marge Simpson: Maybe he just said that to make conversation.
Lisa Simpson: His life was an unbridled success until he found out he was a Simpson.

Homer Simpson: Stupid dog.
Homer Simpson: No! Stay away! This is not for you! This is Homer food.
Marge Simpson: Time to get up, Lisa. (HAPPILY) It's a school day!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, Lisa, you don't look well.
Lisa Simpson: I'll make it, Mom. Just tape my lunch box to my hand.
Marge Simpson: Ohhh.. my, you're burning up, and your cheeks are so swollen. (GASPS) I think you have the mumps. I'm calling Doctor Hibbert.

Dr. Julius Hibbert: (INTO PHONE) Uh, not that I'm angry, but how did you get my home number? (CHUCKLES) I see, quite ingenious.
Marge Simpson: Doctor, I think Lisa has the mumps.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: (CHUCKLES) Well, Mrs. Simpson, much as I'd like to rely on your diagnosis, I think it might be professionally derelict of me to do so. Let me check my schedule.
Marge Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Mm hm. Two o'clock is fine. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.
Bart Simpson: No way! She's faking! If Lisa stays home, I stay home.
Lisa Simpson: If Bart stays home, I'm going to school.
Bart Simpson: Fine. Then... (TOTAL CONFUSION)
Bart Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) Wait a minute. If Lisa goes to school then I go to school, but then Lisa stays home so I stay home, so Lisa goes to school...
Marge Simpson: Lisa, don't confuse your brother like that. Have a nice day at school, Bart.

Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard.
Sylvia Winfield: (INTO PHONE) There's only one family on this block... no, on earth... inconsiderate enough to let a monster like that roam free.
Homer Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? I am going to explain this to you one more time, and then I am going to hang up on you. (AS IF TO A VERY DIM-WITTED CHILD) It is not my dog. I tied my dog outside myself. I am looking at him right -- (ANNOYED GRUNT)

Homer Simpson: Well, well. Mr. Universe takes a walk. Haw, haw!
Ned Flanders: (CHUCKLES) Mr. Universe, I wish!
Homer Simpson: Look at that get-up. Heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and (GASPS)... Assassins!
Ned Flanders: Oh, you betcha! You know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates.
Homer Simpson: Oooh! Oooh! How much? How much? How much?

Lisa Simpson: Oh, no. I don't want to fall behind my class.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Oh, such responsibility for such a little girl! What's your favorite subject?

Lenny Leonard: (SIGHS) Ohh.
Marge Simpson: Well, Lisa, here it is; the Bouvier family quilt.
Lisa Simpson: Wow. Neat. It smells historic.
Marge Simpson: For five generations, women in our family have each added a square to it. Now it's your turn.
Lisa Simpson: Oh, but I don't know how to sew.
Marge Simpson: Oh yes, you do. You just don't know it. The memory of a million drop-stitches flows in your veins.
Lisa Simpson: Very impressive!
Marge Simpson: You try it.
Lisa Simpson: Ow!
Marge Simpson: You just need to develop a callous. See? (HUMMING)

Emily: Now, if I could borrow... (SQUINTING AT FORM) Satan's Little Helper...
Bart Simpson: Santa's Little Helper.
Emily: (TO CLASS) Ladies and gentlemen...
Emily: Most of you already know that, with a little (SACCHARINE) love and compassion, any puppy will grow up to be a cuddly little bundle of joy. Stuff and nonsense, taught by charlatans and learned by bloody twits. Let me tell you the two most important words you will ever hear in your life: choke chain.
Emily: You raise a dog the same way you would raise a child: with simple, authoritative commands... Lay down!
Emily: ...followed by immediate correction...
Martin Prince: How can we tell if we're doing this maneuver effectively?
Emily: The dog's eyes will cross and his tongue will protrude and change color ever so slightly.
Bart Simpson: Is my dog dead, ma'am?
Emily: (LAUGHING) You don't know how often I'm asked that. "Choke chain" is a misnomer. Trust me, they are always breathing.

Jack: (ON T.V.) (LAUGHING) That's because that's the way you love it, baby.
Lisa Simpson: Gee, is it always this good?
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS) Oh, I don't know, I just dip in and out... I'm only watching today because Brandy is coming out of her coma and she knows the phony prince's body is hidden in the boathouse...

Lisa Simpson: Bad dog! (SOOTHINGLY) Don't worry Snowball. You're safe with me.

Marge Simpson: I don't know.
Kelly: Father McGrath! I thought you were dead.
Father McGrath: I was!
(CANINE COLLEGE: EXT. CANINE COLLEGE - ESTABLISHING - DAY)
Emily: There are two ways for a dog to relieve himself. One is like a faithful friend and partner for life. The other is like a hose without a fireman. Which way do you think that was, Mr. Simpson?
Bart Simpson: Like a hose, (UNDER HIS BREATH) your wrinkled highness.
(Simply Shoes: INT. SIMPLY SHOES - AFTERNOON)

Homer Simpson: (READING) "Property of Hom-er J. Simp-son. Hands off."
Lisa Simpson: Look, Mom, I finished my patch. It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life.
Bart Simpson: Miss Winthrop, I was thinking...
Lisa Simpson: (COUGHS) On the left is Mr. Largo, my music teacher at school. He taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul. And on the right is Bleeding Gums Murphy. He taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it.
Marge Simpson: Hm.
Lisa Simpson: And look!
Marge Simpson: (PROUDLY) Come on, Homer. I want you to see what your sick little girl did.
Marge Simpson: (SCREAM)
Marge Simpson: MY QUILT! Six generations, gone. (CRIES)
Homer Simpson: (CALMLY) Now Marge, honey, honey, honey. Come on. Come on, don't get upset. It's not the end of the world. We all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to...
Homer Simpson: (SCREAMS) No, MY COOKIE!
Homer Simpson: This is not happening! This is not happening!
Homer Simpson: Everybody in the kitchen! We're having a family meeting!
Bart Simpson: We never had a family meeting before.
Homer Simpson: We never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
Marge Simpson: Homer, what are you saying?
Homer Simpson: I'm saying...
Bart Simpson: No way! You can't give my dog away! I'll set fire to my hair! I'll rip up all my clothes! I'll put sugar in the gas tank!
Homer Simpson: Bart!
Lisa Simpson: I've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog. But when I look into his vacant brown eyes, I just can't bear to let him go. I'm sure Mom agrees with me.
Marge Simpson: No, I'm afraid I agree with your father.
Homer Simpson: You do? (TAUNTING) Ha ha, ha ha ha!
Marge Simpson: Homer, please. It's not just the quilt. He's a nice dog, but he chews up everything. He doesn't obey. He's not even housebroken. And we've spent all this money on an obedience school and I don't see any improvement.
Bart Simpson: All right, all right. If Santa's Little Helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog, can we keep him then?
Homer Simpson: No.
Bart Simpson: Dad!
Emily: Tch, tch. Oh, dear.
Bart Simpson: ...since you get paid either way, would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass?
Lisa Simpson: Dad, this is our pet. We can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. Are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?
Homer Simpson: (SOBBING) Oh Lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, I want you in my corner, honey.
Marge Simpson: Oh, all right. If he passes obedience school, we can keep him.
Lisa Simpson: Yea!
Bart Simpson: All right!

Come on boy! (PANTS INTO PHONE) Say it, boy! Say "I love you" for the nice man! (TRYING TO SOUND LIKE A GROANING DOG) I lub you. (IN HIS OWN VOICE) Good dog! Good doggie! Isn't that amazing?

(RESOLUTE AGAIN) But my time has not passed yet! The world does not need another college graduate who doesn't know how to sit!
Bart Simpson: He'll sit, he'll sit. (TO DOG) Come on, boy. Sit! Sit!

Lisa Simpson: Huh uh, he smells more like a photo lab.
Homer Simpson: Stop it, both of you. Grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital.
Marge Simpson: Homer, that's terrible. We should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. You know, we'll be old someday.
Homer Simpson: My God, you're right, Marge. You kids wouldn't put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?
Bart Simpson: Well...
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM) Marge, what do we do?
Marge Simpson: Well, I think we better set an example.
Homer Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Absolutely. Our third Sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. Where's some place fun we can take Grampa next time?
Lisa Simpson: To the pony rides.

Grampa Simpson: Herman, a very special lady is having a birthday tomorrow.
Herman Hermann: Ah, the Battleship New Jersey.
Grampa Simpson: No, you idiot. My girlfriend Bea. And since this is the only store I know --
Herman Hermann: (INTERRUPTING) Ah, Grampa, nothing says "I love you" better than a military antique.
Herman Hermann: Let's take a look at the bayonet case. Huh?
Grampa Simpson: Hey, what's that?
Herman Hermann: That, my friend, was Napoleon's hat.
Grampa Simpson: It doesn't look like Napoleon's hat.
Herman Hermann: Well, it's not the famous hat. It's the one he wore for a week in April, 1796, just before he defeated the Sardinians.
Grampa Simpson: Ooh. How much?
Herman Hermann: Four hundred dollars.
Grampa Simpson: I'll give you five bucks.
Herman Hermann: That's not the kind of offer you should make to a man with a Gattling gun under the counter. Why don't you try Grandma's World.

Grampa Simpson: I can't go. It's my girlfriend Bea's birthday.
Homer Simpson: (DISBELIEVING) Oh, you have a girlfriend. Heh, heh, heh.
Homer Simpson: Well, Happy Birthday, Bea. (CHUCKLING) (TO GRAMPA) She can come with us. Hey, (indicating empty room) there's room for all your friends in the car.
Grampa Simpson: No, she's not invisible, you idiot. (SHOWING GIFT) See, it's her birthday tonight.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, right.
Homer Simpson: (ANGRILY) Hey you kids, stop kicking the seat!
Grampa Simpson: I'm kicking the seat!
Marge Simpson: Dad, don't you want to know where we're going?

Homer Simpson: (ANGRY WITH THEM) Well, let 'em sleep on their own time!
Marge Simpson: Homer, are you sure this is the right way? The road seems to have gotten awfully bumpy.
Homer Simpson: (SCREAM)
Grampa Simpson: What a wing ding. This is much better than my girlfriend's birthday party.
Marge Simpson: Homer?
Homer Simpson: Bart, get out and push.
Lisa Simpson: Yeah, Bart, get out and push.
Bart Simpson: No way, José.

Jasper Beardly: You don't know how right you are, Abe.
Grampa Simpson: What?
Jasper Beardly: I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but Bea passed away last night.
Grampa Simpson: Ohhhhh, noooo.
Jasper Beardly: It was her ticker. The Doc said her left ventricle burst.
Grampa Simpson: (LOOKS AT AMBULANCE) Ohhh. (SADLY TURNING TO JASPER) No, Jasper. They may say she died of a burst ventricle, but I know she died of a broken heart.
(Cemetery: Ext. Cemetery - Day)
Grampa Simpson: I can tell she really cared for me. She didn't make me a pall bearer.
Homer Simpson: I can't tell you how sorry I am, Dad.
Grampa Simpson: Is someone talking to me? I didn't hear anything.
Homer Simpson: (UPSET) Oh no! Dad's lost his hearing.
Grampa Simpson: No, you idiot. I'm ignoring you. You made me miss the last precious moments of Bea's life. I'll never speak to you again.
Grampa Simpson: I have no son!!!

Grampa Simpson: Oh, Bea.
Lionel Hutz: It was a beautiful service, wasn't it, Mr. Simpson?
Grampa Simpson: (LOOKING UP) Who the hell are you?
Lionel Hutz: Lionel Hutz, attorney-at-law. I'm the executor of Beatrice Simmons' estate. Mr. Simpson, Bea was a wealthy woman and, surprise, surprise, she left everything to you.
Grampa Simpson: Really?
Lionel Hutz: (Mysteriously) There is one catch: You must spend one night in... (Ominous) a haunted house.
Lionel Hutz: (GOOD-NATUREDLY) Just kidding. Just kidding. Here's a check for one hundred and six thousand dollars, (READING) "to enjoy as you see fit." Ah, I'm touched.
Grampa Simpson: A hundred and six thousand dollars?
Lionel Hutz: Ta-ta, Mr. Simpson. By the way, old timer, I do wills. Why don't I just give you this pen with my phone number on it. It looks just like a cigar! Isn't that something!
Homer Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Yell-o.
Grampa Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Homer?
Homer Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Whoo-hoo. It's Dad. Dad's on the phone. He's calling me.
Homer Simpson: Oh Dad. Oh, I knew you'd forgive me.
Grampa Simpson: I haven't forgiven you. I just inherited a hundred and six thousand dollars and I just had to tell you that you're not getting one thin dime. Heh, heh.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT)
Mr. Hazelwood: Mr. Simpson?
Grampa Simpson: (SCREAMS) What is it?
Mr. Hazelwood: I couldn't help overhearing about your new-found fortune, and uh let me assure you that here at the Springfield Retirement Castle, money does make a difference.
Grampa Simpson: Huh?
(Beach: ext. beach - day)
Mr. Hazelwood: I mean, there are rub-downs and then there are rub-downs.

Grampa Simpson: Oh, I'm glad you're keepin' busy.
BEA: Now, listen Abe. I want to know why my money isn't bringing you happiness.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, Bea, I'm not cut out for the high life.
BEA: Abraham. If you're not happy with the money, why don't you spread it around? Make other people as happy as you made me.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, thanks Bea, I will.
BEA: And go see your son -- he misses you.
Grampa Simpson: Aw, I miss him, too, the big fat dickens. (THINKS) Hey, Bea, I've got to ask you, what was death like?

Homer Simpson: I miss my Daddy.

Grampa Simpson: Is there room at your table for a foolish old man?

Bart Simpson: Choose your corncob! En garde!
Lisa Simpson: Challenge accepted!
Grampa Simpson: All my precious sacks of gold...
Homer Simpson: (BURP)
Grampa Simpson: ...couldn't buy me the pleasures of a simple family meal.
Homer Simpson: Pass the bug juice, Dad.
Grampa Simpson: Wait your turn, you pig. (RETURNING TO THE POINT) I have an announcement to make. I have decided to give Bea's money away. There are people who really need it. I'm gonna let them come to me and plead their case, and then I'll decide who needs it most.
Lisa Simpson: Grampa, that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table.
Bart Simpson: Give it to us, Grampa.
Homer Simpson: Bart! Forgive him, Dad. He's just a stupid little kid who says the first thing that pops into his head. (THEN) But, you know, there's wisdom in his innocence.
Grampa Simpson: You don't want it.
Homer Simpson: Yes, I do.
Grampa Simpson: Too bad. You ain't getting it.

KENT: (TO CAMERA) Not since this reporter's marriage to Stephanie, the weather lady, has this town been so consumed with rumor and innuendo. All because of this man.
KENT: Today, one Abraham "Grampa" Simpson announced that he will give away over a hundred thousand dollars to the person - or persons - he finds most deserving.
KENT: (TO CAMERA) Is Grampa Simpson a modern day saint, a rich nut, or both? Only time will tell.
KENT: (TO CAMERA) This is Kent Brockman on line for an old man's money.
Bart Simpson: Yeah.
Grampa Simpson: I don't know.

Grampa Simpson: Next!
C. Montgomery Burns: Grampa -- I can call you Grampa, can't I?
Grampa Simpson: Yeah, yeah... go ahead.
C. Montgomery Burns: I need that money. Please, please...
Grampa Simpson: Wait... wait a minute... wait. You're the guy who owns the nuclear power plant.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, the ownership is divided.
Grampa Simpson: What the hell do you think you're doing?
C. Montgomery Burns: Mr. Simpson, I dread the day when a hundred thousand dollars isn't worth groveling for.
Grampa Simpson: Get outta here.
C. Montgomery Burns: You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, old man.
Moe Szyslak: Here's the deal, Grampa. A guy, I think was an explorer, left this in the bar one night. It may be a map to ancient treasure, or directions to some guy's house, but to find out, we'll need money, we'll need provisions, and a two man diving bell.
Grampa Simpson: It's pretty stupid, but so far you're the front runner.
Moe Szyslak: (PLEASED SOUND)
MONROE: It's a special isolation chamber. The subject pulls levers to receive food and warmth. The floor can become electrified and showers of icy water randomly fall on the subject. (PROUDLY) I call it the Monroe Box.
Grampa Simpson: Huh, uh. Well, it sounds interesting.
MONROE: Huh uh.
Grampa Simpson: How much will it cost to build?
MONROE: Oh, that's the beauty part, it's already built. I need the money to buy a baby to raise in the box until the age of thirty.
Grampa Simpson: What are you trying to prove?
MONROE: Well my theory is that the subject will be socially maladjusted and will harbor a deep resentment towards me.
Grampa Simpson: Hm, interesting.
Bart Simpson: Let's see, I want a teargas can, a blue gun with paralyzer darts...
Bart Simpson: A copy of Radioactive Man number 27. That's the first time he fights Dr. Crab. Then I wanna buy that baseball card where the guy is flippin' the bird.
Grampa Simpson: Oh yeah, I've seen that one.
Bart Simpson: Oh and the (INDECIPHERABLE)
Grampa Simpson: What the hell is that?
Professor Jonathan Frink: Why, it's a death ray, my good man. Behold!
Grampa Simpson: Hey, feels warm. Kinda nice.
Professor Jonathan Frink: Well, it's just the prototype. With proper funding, I'm confident this little baby could destroy an area the size of New York City.
Grampa Simpson: But I want to help people, not kill 'em.
Professor Jonathan Frink: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh. To be honest, the ray only has evil applications.
Professor Jonathan Frink: You know, my wife will be happy. She's hated this whole death ray thing from day one.
Grampa Simpson: (WEARILY) Oh Lisa. What makes you think you deserve all that money?
Lisa Simpson: I don't deserve it, Grampa. No one here does. The people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums. They're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet. Of course, if you really wanted to, you could buy me a pony.
Grampa Simpson: You're right.
Lisa Simpson: I'll name her Princess and I'll ride her every day.
Grampa Simpson: No, you're right about all the poor souls who need a helping hand. I need to take a walk to clear my head.
Grampa Simpson: Oh, I'm exhausted.
Jasper Beardly: Oh, poor baby. Been lifting your wallet?
Grampa Simpson: No, I'll have you know, I've decided to give my money away to truly needy causes. But a hundred thousand dollars just isn't enough. I need more.
Jasper Beardly: Well, why don't you go on the seniors gambling junket? I bet you could double your money or even triple it.
Grampa Simpson: Well, it's tempting.
Jasper Beardly: Plus, they've got a ninety-nine cent shrimp cocktail.
Grampa Simpson: You've sold me.

Croupier: Twenty, black.
Homer Simpson: Holy Moly! You're winning!
Grampa Simpson: Beat it, boy, you're crampin' my style.
Homer Simpson: Dad! Please, you gotta quit while you're ahead. You understand that, take all your money and leave now.
Grampa Simpson: Sorry, boy, I have to get enough to help everybody.
Homer Simpson: But you could lose everything. Come on.
Grampa Simpson: Homer, I think Rudyard Kipling said it best: "If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss... Yours is the earth and everything that's in it. And -- which is more -- you'll be a man, my son."
Homer Simpson: You'll be a bonehead. Come on.
Lisa Simpson: (SMALL GASP)
Grampa Simpson: (TO CROUPIER) Put it all on forty-one. I've got a feeling about that number.
Croupier: The wheel only goes to thirty-six, sir.
Grampa Simpson: Okay, put it all on thirty-six. I've got a feeling about that number.
Homer Simpson: Dad, no! Gimme that.
Grampa Simpson: Get your clammy paws off my money.
Homer Simpson: Gimme me that money. Ow! You're hurting me.
Grampa Simpson: Thirty-six, no!
Croupier: No more bets.
Grampa Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Son, if this lands on thirty-six, I'll...
Croupier: Double zero.

Kent Brockman: I understand that, Krusty. Isn't that exactly what you said right before the recall of tainted Krusty Brand Mayonnaise?
Krusty the Clown: (ANGRILY) Now Kent, you know that question is out of bounds. This interview is over.
Homer Simpson: All right family, I want the truth. Don't pull any punches. Am I just a little bit overweight?

(OLD ARMORY HALL: int. old armory hall - a week later)
Marge Simpson: I can't believe it.
BART & LISA: Yay, Mom!
Homer Simpson: Woo-ooo! I'm a work of art! "Last Supper", eat your heart out!
(Burns's Office: int. burns' office - the next day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, you ham-fisted, nearsighted house painter? Smithers, throw this on the dung heap.
Artist: I'm sorry, but this isn't working out. I quit.
C. Montgomery Burns: (INNOCENTLY) Well, Smithers, I guess that's what you call your "artistic temperament".
Waylon Smithers: Sir, I must remind you that the dedication of the Burns Wing of the museum is only six days away.
C. Montgomery Burns: Damnation, Smithers! This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!
Marge Simpson: Okay, shoot.
Waylon Smithers: Sir, I'm afraid you've systematically alienated Springfield's entire art community. The only one left is this Mrs. Homer Simpson.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CONFUSED) Who?
Waylon Smithers: (LOOKING OVER THE ARTICLE) Well, she won first prize in the Springfield Art Fair, and as the wife of an employee, she'll be easily intimidated.
C. Montgomery Burns: Excellent. Once again the wheel has turned and Dame Fortune has hugged Montgomery Burns to her sweet perfumed bosom. Somebody up there likes me, Smithers.
Waylon Smithers: Somebody down here likes you, too, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Shut up.
Homer Simpson: Woo woo! Two forty nine! Yeah!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - kitchen - morning)
Homer Simpson: Marge, Marge. Look at me! My clothes are just hanging off me!
Marge Simpson: Oh, that's wonderful, isn't it kids?
Lisa Simpson: Pass the moo juice.
Marge Simpson: Kids. Remember what I told you about showing a little support.
Lisa Simpson: Way to go, Dad.
Bart Simpson: You look mahvelous.
Homer Simpson: (TEARY) What a family.
(Springfield Nuclear Power Plant: INT. POWER PLANT - SNACK AREA - DAY)
Delivery Man: Hey, what gives? These donuts are pilin' up!
Carl Carlson: Yeah, Homer Simpson went on a diet.
Delivery Man: Oh my God! And I just bought a boat!
(Simpson Home: ext. simpson house - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, don't people answer the door these days?
Waylon Smithers: Allow me, sir.
Waylon Smithers: Open up!
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns. Would you like to come in?
Waylon Smithers: Mr. Burns would like to commission you to do a portrait of him. Have you ever painted the rich and powerful?
Marge Simpson: Well, no... just Ringo Starr.
C. Montgomery Burns: (WITH DIFFICULTY) Rin-go?
Waylon Smithers: He was the drummer for a rock 'n roll combo called the Beatles, sir.
C. Montgomery Burns: Beatles, eh? Oh, yes. I seem to remember their off-key caterwauling on the old Sullivan show. What was he thinking? (TO MARGE) Mrs. Simpson, this commission and all its glory can be yours, but first you must look me straight in the eye and answer one simple question.
C. Montgomery Burns: Can you make me beautiful?
Marge Simpson: I don't think that will be a problem.
C. Montgomery Burns: I'm no matinee idol.
Marge Simpson: Well, maybe not, but I have the gift of being able to see inner beauty.
C. Montgomery Burns: Hmmm. (NODS) Mrs. Simpson, you may immortalize me.
Waylon Smithers: Ah, sir, at last the world will see you as I always have.
C. Montgomery Burns: Yes, yes, yes! Now don't be stingy with the blush, Smithers.
MR. BURNS' GEOMETRIC SHAPES: Now you! Paint!
Homer Simpson: Honey, I'm home!
C. Montgomery Burns: Oh, there's an original sentiment.
Homer Simpson: (SHRIEKS)
C. Montgomery Burns: Take it outside, Simpson. I'm male modeling.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) I'm painting his portrait, Homer.
Homer Simpson: (FALSELY CHEERY) Oh, isn't that wonderful. My work and my home life come together in such a nice way. (LOW) Marge, may I see you in the other room?
Homer Simpson: Honey, he's nuts. He thinks he's handsome. Please, make him look handsome. Please, please, please, please...
Marge Simpson: Now, Homer, don't worry. All I need to do is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty.
Homer Simpson: (MOANS)
Marge Simpson: What were you like as a boy, Mr. Burns? Did you have a dog that you loved.
C. Montgomery Burns: Well, aieeee! There's something on my leg! Get it off! Get it off!
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, she's just a baby.
Homer Simpson: All right, all right, who took the funny pages?
Waylon Smithers: So, Ziggy goes to the repair shop and there's a sign on the doorbell reading "Out Of Order."
C. Montgomery Burns: (CHUCKLE) Ah, Ziggy... will you ever win?
Marge Simpson: Oh, my.
C. Montgomery Burns: (COVERING HIMSELF) If you'll excuse me, I'm changing for a board meeting.
Marge Simpson: (FLUSTERED) I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.
Bart Simpson: Hey, Mom. Did he have those spots all over his body?
C. Montgomery Burns: (STICKING HEAD OUT) I heard that.
Bart Simpson: Oops.
Waylon Smithers: Would you feel more comfortable if I left, too, sir?
C. Montgomery Burns: Of course not, Smithers. You're like a doctor.
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers, I want my tea!
Marge Simpson: Doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
Waylon Smithers: (CHUCKLES) Actually, I value every second we're together -- from the moment I squeeze his orange juice in the morning, till I tuck him in at night. He's not just my boss, he's my best friend, too.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TASTING) Bah! Too hot!
Waylon Smithers: You're right, sir. It's scalding me as we speak.
(ENGLISH COUNTRY MANOR: ext. english country manor - day)
RINGO: (AS HE TYPES) Dear Sally. In response to your letter of December the twelfth 1966, me favorite color is blue and me real first name is Richard. Thanks for the snapshot. You're a real cute bird. Luv, Ringo. P.S. Forgive the lateness of my reply.
WETHERBY: Mr. Starr, tea and crumpets.
RINGO: (PREOCCUPIED) Just set it over there.
WETHERBY: Sir, if you'll forgive an old Brit his impertinence, your devotion to your fans is nothing short of remarkable.
RINGO: Well, Wetherby, they took the time to write me and I don't care if it takes me another twenty years... I'm going to answer every one of them.
RINGO: (RE: PACKAGE) Hello! What's this?
RINGO: From Springfield, U.S.A.
RINGO: (DELIGHTED) Gear!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Will you cease that infernal tootling!
Lisa Simpson: I was just practicing.
Marge Simpson: (THROUGH HER TEETH) Mr. Burns, it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old girl.
C. Montgomery Burns: We've only got two days left, so I'd advise you to shut up and paint!
Marge Simpson: (MURMURS ANGRILY)
Homer Simpson: All right, scale. You don't like me and I don't like you, but I've been very good, so you better treat me right.
Homer Simpson: All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!
Homer Simpson: Marge! I'm two-thirty-nine and I'm feeling fine! Look! I'm using the original notches that came with my belt.
Marge Simpson: That's wonderful Homer, I'm so proud of...
C. Montgomery Burns: Let me get this straight. You're pleased with your current appearance? (LAUGHS) Ah, why my good man, you're the fattest thing I've ever seen. And I've been on safari.
Homer Simpson: (SNIFFLING) If you need me, I'll be in the refrigerator.
Marge Simpson: Mr. Burns, I've had enough of your... posing. I can finish the portrait myself.
C. Montgomery Burns: (TO SMITHERS) Thank goodness. Another day in this suburban nightmare and I would've needed half a white valium. (TO MARGE, CHEERY) Thank you for your gracious hospitality. See you at the unveiling.
Marge Simpson: Homer, what are you doing?!
Homer Simpson: No. Burns is right. What's the use?
Marge Simpson: Don't you listen to him. He's just a mean little S.O.B.
Homer Simpson: (ANNOYED GRUNT) Marge.
Marge Simpson: I thought there was some good in everybody until I met him.
Homer Simpson: Yeah, well, just so long as you paint a nice picture of him by noon tomorrow.
Marge Simpson: I don't think I can.
Homer Simpson: (NERVOUS) What?! Marge, you have to.
Marge Simpson: I can't make that man beautiful. I'm just not good enough. I guess I'm no artist.
Homer Simpson: Hello, what's this?
Homer Simpson: It's for you, Marge. From merry old England.
Marge Simpson: (EXCITED) From the desk of Ringo Starr!
RINGO: Dear Marge. Thanks for the fab painting of yours truly. I hung it on me wall. You're quite an artist. In answer to your question, yes, we do have hamburgers and fries in England, but we call french fries chips. Luv, Ringo. P.S. Forgive the lateness of my reply.
Marge Simpson: (SIGHS DREAMILY)
Homer Simpson: Come on, Marge. Paint. I think you can do it.
Marge Simpson: (COYLY) Okay, Homer. If you think I can.
(SPRINGFIELD ART MUSEUM: ext. springfield art museum - day)
C. Montgomery Burns: Friends, art lovers, security personnel. Today is a red letter day for the Springfield Palace of Fine Art. A new wing for our museum and a portrait commemorating the man who ponied up the dough.
C. Montgomery Burns: Ladies and gentlemen, may I invite you to behold... Montgomery Burns!
C. Montgomery Burns: Smithers!
Professor Lombardo: I don't care for this at all.
Kids: (LOUDER) Ewwwwww!
Martin Prince: Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing the children.
Bart Simpson: More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos!
Marge Simpson: Umm... Hello. My name is Marge Simpson and I painted this. Maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. Well, I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of God's creatures.
Dr. Julius Hibbert: Provocative, but powerful.
MRS. HOOVER: He's bad, but he'll die. So I like it.
C. Montgomery Burns: (CALLING) Marge... a word, please.
C. Montgomery Burns: You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate. And I don't hate this. Your painting is bold but beautiful. (CONFIDENTIALLY) And uh, incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia.
Marge Simpson: (TO HOMER) I thought I did.
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - MORNING)
JANEY: Did you hear about Miss Hoover? She drank a bottle of drain cleaner by mistake.
Chuck: Uh, I heard she fell down a well.
Seymour Skinner: Come on now. Oh.
Lisa Simpson: My god, she's been dumped again.
Miss Hoover: Children, I won't be staying long. I just came from the doctor and I have Lyme disease. Principal Skinner will run the class until a substitute arrives.
Ralph Wiggum: (RAISING HAND) What's Lyme disease?
Seymour Skinner: Uh, I'll field that one. Lyme disease is spread by small parasites, called ticks. When a diseased tick attaches itself to you and begins sucking your blood,
Miss Hoover: (ANGUISHED SIGH)
Seymour Skinner: Malignant spirochetes infest your bloodstream, eventually spreading to your spinal fluid, and on into the brain.
Miss Hoover: The brain? Oh, dear God!
Seymour Skinner: Come on, Elizabeth. Come, come.
Seymour Skinner: (TOO FRIENDLY) Well now, children, here we are, open your primers to page 32.
Seymour Skinner: Ah, substraction.
Seymour Skinner: (ANGRY) Bart Simpson... I know it's you.
Bart Simpson: (MATTER OF FACT) And here comes Snowball II. This is the one we kept.
Kids: Ewwwwwww!
Bart Simpson: We were going to keep the gray one, but the mother ate her.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: As usual, I agree with you, Martin. Bart, shut that off and take your seat immediately.
Bart Simpson: (PICKING UP REMOTE CONTROL) Oh look, this is really cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
Kids: (SCREAM)
Seymour Skinner: No children, your not seeing things, this, my little friends, is a schwa.
Seymour Skinner: Are you the substitute?
BERGSTROM: Yes, sir. Yes I am.
Seymour Skinner: Are you insane?
BERGSTROM: No, no sir. No, I'm not. It's my way of getting their attention.
Seymour Skinner: Well, all right. (TO KIDS, TOO FRIENDLY) Play friendly with your new teacher, children!
BERGSTROM: (TEXAS ACCENT) Howdy. I am a Texas cowboy. The year is 1830. You young'uns ask me any questions you like.
Chuck: (RAISING HAND) Can we play kickball instead of science after lunch?
BERGSTROM: Kickball? Son, there ain't no kickball in 1830. Any other questions?
BERGSTROM: Shoot! It's awfully quiet on the plains here. Well, how about this? Everybody, I want to see two eyes on every single person staring right at me, right now. There are three things wrong with my costume. Anybody names those three things will get my hat.
Lisa Simpson: (RAISING HAND) I believe I know the answer.
BERGSTROM: Well, well, wha... wha...what's your name?
Lisa Simpson: Lisa Simpson.
BERGSTROM: Well, go ahead, Miss Simpson.
Lisa Simpson: Um, one: Your belt buckle says "State of Texas", but Texas wasn't a state until 1845.
BERGSTROM: Very good.
Lisa Simpson: Two: the revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
BERGSTROM: That's excellent.
Lisa Simpson: Three: You seem to be of the Jewish faith.
BERGSTROM: Are you sure I'm Jewish?
Lisa Simpson: Or Italian?
BERGSTROM: I'm Jewish.
Lisa Simpson: And there weren't any Jewish cowboys.
Terri/sherri: Speech! Speech!
Bart Simpson: I had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
Kids: (LAUGHING)
BERGSTROM: Very good! That's excellent! And I'm also wearing a digital watch, but I'll accept that. Here you go, little lady. And for the record there were a few Jewish cowboys, ladies and gentlemen. Big guys, who were great shots, and spent money freely. I'm Mr. Bergstrom. Feel free to make fun of my name if you want. Two suggestions are Mister Nerdstrom and Mister Boogerstrom.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Boys and girls, today we will begin selecting a class president.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: I'm not allowed to vote, but I strongly suggest you elect Martin. Martin...
Martin Prince: As your president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an A-B-C of the Overlords of the genre: Asimov, Master, Clarke...
Wendell Borton: (RAISING HAND) What about Ray Bradbury?
Martin Prince: (DISMISSING) I'm aware of his work. (TO CLASS) Thank you and (OMINOUSLY) keep watching the skies.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Excellent (APPLAUDING) Excellent, Martin.
BERGSTROM: If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song about cowboys? Now this one's not very accurate, but we can fix it up as we go along. Okay?
BERGSTROM: (SINGING) Home, home on the range. (SPEAKING QUICKLY) Actually, the range was far from home, it was a very desolate place where danger and disease rode tall in the saddle. (SINGING) Where the deer and the antelope play. (SPEAKING) Unlike the efficient Indians, cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope and they threw the rest away.
BERGSTROM: (SINGING) Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, and the skies are not cloudy all day.
BERGSTROM: Hey, what's this? Did you do it?
Lisa Simpson: (NERVOUS) No! No! It wasn't me! I would never do anything like that. It was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --
BERGSTROM: It's neat. Can I have it? (TO CLASS)
Lisa Simpson: Yes, but I didn't do it.
BERGSTROM: Are you sure you didn't do it? It's good.
Lisa Simpson: No, but I'm starting to wish I had.
BERGSTROM: (CHUCKLES) Ladies and gentlemen, the Singing Dork!
Classmate: (WHISPERS) Lisa (CHUCKLES)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Any other nominations?
Terri/sherri: We nominate Bart Simpson!
(Moe's Tavern: Int. Moe's - continuous)
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Children! (FRIENDLY) Bart, I need someone very reliable to deliver an important message to the principal's office.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Would you do it for me?
Bart Simpson: (PLAYING TO CROWD) Why, Mrs. Krabappel! How would I know where the principal's office is?
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: People, what have I told you about encouraging him? When Bart wins approval for making a fool of himself, it makes him think that --
Milhouse Van Houten: (POINTING TO DOOR) Yay, Bart!
BERGSTROM: (READING IN A WHISPER) Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair, knew that a grey spider had played the most important part of all. No one was with her when she died."
BERGSTROM: Come on, Janey, everybody has a talent. I want to see yours, that's all.
JANEY: I don't have a talent.
BERGSTROM: You cannot talk like that. There has to be something that you can do better than anybody else.
JANEY: Well, I can do this --
BERGSTROM: Yes! Great! Ok, how about you, Ralph?
BERGSTROM: Wonderful! Chuck?
BERGSTROM: Oh, that's disgusting. I love it! Lisa... come on, you're holding out on us. I see a saxophone over there!
Lisa Simpson: I can't.
BERGSTROM: Come on, Lisa, I bet you're good.
Lisa Simpson: No, really, I can't.
BERGSTROM: Sure you can; just try.
Lisa Simpson: Please don't make me do it.
BERGSTROM: All right. You owe me something special.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: So while I'm technically still married, there really hasn't been any marriage to speak of since Mister Krabappel moved into his little "love nest."
BERGSTROM: This profession can put a lot of strain on a marriage.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: (ENTICINGLY) Since he's been gone, I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.
BERGSTROM: (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.
Edna Krabappel-Flanders: Well...
BERGSTROM: I'm sorry, Mrs. Krabappel, you're very nice, but it's the children I love.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - THE NEXT MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: (DREAMILY) When I fall asleep, Mr. Bergstrom is the last thing I think of, and he's my first thought when I wake up.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, I feel that way about your father.
Lisa Simpson: No, no. You don't understand. (DREAMILY) When Mr. Bergstrom smiles, you only see these teeth --
Lisa Simpson: -- but when you really make him laugh, you can see these two teeth. I think they're called the eye teeth.
Lisa Simpson: I don't know if he had orthodontic work or what, but they're absolutely perfect.
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, I notice little things about your father, too.
Lisa Simpson: No, Mom. This is different. I mean, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.
Marge Simpson: (FIRMLY) Your father does that to me.
Lisa Simpson: Mom, are we gonna talk, or are we gonna talk?
Marge Simpson: (MEASURED ANGER) Lisa, we can talk, but first you have to accept the fact that I feel that way about your father!
Lisa Simpson: Fine.
Lisa Simpson: (TO MARGE) Yesterday, he read us "Charlotte's Web", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears.
Homer Simpson: A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!
Bart Simpson: (RUBBING EYES) Waaaaaaaah!
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON)
BERGSTROM: Remember, nobody, and I mean nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock, that's volcanic, and one sedimentary, and that is layered. Lisa, can I see to you for a minute.
Lisa Simpson: (LOW) Yes! (LOUDER) Yes, Mr. Bergstrom?
BERGSTROM: Lisa, your homework is always so neat. How can I put this? Does your father help you with it?
Lisa Simpson: No. Homework's not my father's specialty.
BERGSTROM: Well, there's no shame in it. I mean my Dad could really --
Lisa Simpson: Not mine.
BERGSTROM: You didn't let me finish.
Lisa Simpson: Unless the next word was burp, you didn't have to.
(Elementary - Bart's Classroom: INT. ELEMENTARY - BART'S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON)
Martin Prince: In a sample taken in this very classroom, a state inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos --
Bart Simpson: That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! More Asbestos!
(Simpson Home: int. simpson house - living room)
Homer Simpson: Wow! You made the front page.
Bart Simpson: (DISMISSING) Aw, Dad. It's just a popularity contest.
Homer Simpson: Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, what's more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?
Bart Simpson: Sure, why not?
Homer Simpson: Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. (SAVORING) President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?
Bart Simpson: (WARMING TO IT) Hm, yeah.
Homer Simpson: Now, go get 'em.
Bart Simpson: He says, there aren't any easy answers! I say, he's not looking hard enough!
Kids: Yay!
(Springfield Elementary School: INT. ELEMENTARY - LISA'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS)
Lisa Simpson: Oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator.
BERGSTROM: (POINTS TO BART) You're going to miss your brother's antics.
Lisa Simpson: When?
BERGSTROM: When? When your life takes you places the rest of us have only heard about.
Lisa Simpson: Places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?
BERGSTROM: Yes, there is such a place, believe me. It's true.
Lisa Simpson: I believe everything you say, with your words, your body language and your Semitic good looks.
Ralph Wiggum: (READING) "Dear Miss Hoover: You have Lyme disease. We miss you. Kevin's biting me. Come back soon. Here is a drawing of a spirochete. Love, Ralph."
BERGSTROM: Oh, that's great, Ralph!
BERGSTROM: Hey, kids. I've learned that in two weeks the Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing forever due to a lack of interest. I urge you to see it while you can.
(Simpson Home: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVINGING ROOM - THAT NIGHT)
Marge Simpson: Hmmm, Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and I think you should take her.
Homer Simpson: The Museum!
Marge Simpson: Hmmm huh.
Homer Simpson: Tomorrow... ugh; oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching T.V... spending some time with the boy. Spending time with the boy. The boy needs attention, Marge.
Marge Simpson: Homer, I've been talking to Lisa and I'm concerned about your relationship with her.
Bart Simpson: (MOCK CONCERN) Me, too, Mom. I think they're drifting apart.
Homer Simpson: Shut up, boy.
Marge Simpson: Homer, please.
Homer Simpson: Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. (TO HIMSELF) Lousy brain.
(Museum: INT. MUSEUM - ADMISSION AREA - DAY)
Homer Simpson: Hey, what do you mean by, "Suggested Donation"?
Woman In Booth: Pay any amount you wish, sir.
Homer Simpson: And what if I "wish" to pay zero?
Woman In Booth: Then it's up to you.
Homer Simpson: Oooh, so it's up to me, is it?
Woman In Booth: Yes.
Homer Simpson: (CHORTLES) I see, and you think that people are gonna pay you four dollars and fifty cents, even though they don't have to, just out of the goodness of their... (SCORNFUL LAUGH) Well, anything you say! Good luck, lady! You're gonna need it!
Lisa Simpson: (DELIGHTED) Mr. Bergstrom!
BERGSTROM: Hi, Lisa.
Homer Simpson: Hey! You don't have to pay! Read the sign!
BERGSTROM: (TO LISA) And this must be your father.
BERGSTROM: His teeth had jagged edges to rip through your body, but he could've swallowed you whole!
Lisa Simpson: Wow!
BERGSTROM: Actually, Mr. Simpson, they do know a great deal about the process of mummification. First, they pulled the brain out through the nose with an iron hook, and stuffed the insides with sawdust and onions!
Lisa Simpson: Ewww. Gross.
Homer Simpson: Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man.
Lisa Simpson: Oh Lord.
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson... I'm gonna be presumptuous. I have noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
Homer Simpson: She said that?
BERGSTROM: Well, no, she didn't say it, but, you know, she...
Homer Simpson: (SHAKY) But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, "Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- " (CRYING)
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson, you have got to be a bigger man. There is a wonderful girl's future at stake.
Homer Simpson: (SNAPPING OUT OF IT) Well, if she's so wonderful, give her an A.
BERGSTROM: I am giving her an A.
Homer Simpson: Great. But don't tell her it was a favor to me. Tell her she earned it.
BERGSTROM: Mr. Simpson, she did earn it.
Homer Simpson: You are smooth. I'll give you that.
(SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRCASE: INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING)
Lisa Simpson: He ruined the one chance I had of getting to know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.
Marge Simpson: Well... I'll tell you what. Why don't we invite Mr. Bergstrom to dinner?
Lisa Simpson: Oh, Mom, that's wonderful. Can I find out his favorite dish and help you make it!
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Lisa Simpson: Can I wear your jewelry?
Marge Simpson: Sure.
Lisa Simpson: Can I get my ears pierced?
Marge Simpson: No.
Lisa Simpson: Can I dye my shoes pink?
Marge Simpson: Yes.
Lisa Simpson: Can I paint my nails?
Marge Simpson: No.

Miss Hoover: Good morning, Lisa.
Miss Hoover: (OFF LISA'S REACTION) I'm back.
Miss Hoover: You see, class, my Lyme disease turned out to be...
Miss Hoover: Psy-cho-so-ma-tic.
Ralph Wiggum: Does that mean you were crazy?
